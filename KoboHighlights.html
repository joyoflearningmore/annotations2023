As an all-round structural material it is unmatched. It is lighter than water, yet weight for weight is as stiff, strong, and tough as steel and can resist both being stretched and compressed. It is easy to shape, as it readily splits along the grain, and is soft enough to carve, especially when green. It can be found in pieces large enough to hold up houses, yet can be cut up into tools as small as a toothpick. It can last for centuries if it is kept permanently dry or wet, yet it can also be burned to keep us warm, to cook our food, and drive a wide range of industrial processes. With all these advantages, the central role of wood in the human story was not just explicable, but inevitable.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R20" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">21</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Age of Wood</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Roland Ennos</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2022-05-24 18:30:48</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr"> you think about it, a tree is a tricky place in which to live. The wooden structure has a complex branching shape, with a vertical trunk that bifurcates successively into more horizontal and thinner boughs, branches, and twigs, structures that eventually end in the productive parts of the tree, the leaves. Having binocular vision helps primates judge distances and move about more quickly and more safely around the canopy.

Next come those who follow the law but neglect Bible study. The palm, which bears edible fruit but has no perfume, is their representative. Then there are those who study but don’t practise, and like myrtle they are perfumed but bear no fruit.

By choosing to erase certain lines and extend and repeat others outward over an infinite grid, they created innumerable patterns that were all derived from the original circle, which in its oneness was emblematic of God.

Early on, several of the men judge, scoff, and pay lip service to the whole ordeal. But eventually the dam breaks for everyone. Some of the men go into a blind rage after particular comments from group members prick their suppressed pain. They punch and writhe. Their neck veins pop. One of the visitors, Brian, emits a guttural howl that sounds like the devil is flying out of his chest. But after these bouts of explosive anger and violence come tears. Some men nearly collapse in exhaustion, having finally let this suppressed pain out of their body. In Brian’s case, his face transforms after punching and screaming and crying. It’s an epic expulsion of emotion. It takes multiple incarcerated men to restrain him. When the outburst is over, Brian’s eyes are lighter. He literally looks like a different person.<br>			 As I sat in the theater watching all of this unfold, I started sobbing. I wept for over an hour, drenching my sleeves and notebook.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R654" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">655</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Life on Delay</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">John Hendrickson</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-03-31 08:47:26</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">David Rogier, the CEO and cofounder of MasterClass, told me he prefers to deliver his presentations without a script so he can maneuver around certain sounds or pepper in curse words to help aid his fluency—something he learned from fellow stutterer Samuel L.

There were also plenty of gawkers from the publishing world, there only for the controversy, and a handful of agitators, bleating in the back row.<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R722" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">723</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Biography of X</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Catherine Lacey</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-04-18 13:30:44</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">“I think everybody reaches a point when there’s no way forward,” he said, “and most people just stop right there.

My wife and I despised a sizable percentage of the art Ginny displayed and sold at Quarry, though of course X attended every opening Ginny asked her to attend, and would fawn over the artist if Ginny nudged her to do so.

There was even a pane of framed plexiglass hanging on the wall, a work by a new artist whose prices were already cresting five figures.

Of course, I always had my boys memorize photographs of the major critics and curators, but this was truly hilarious, I thought—how was this kid to know, by sight alone, whether someone was important? I can’t say why I even entertained the notion, but I went out to the gallery and there she was, wearing this loose silk dress that went to the floor, some kind of circular pattern, but it was the way she was looking at the work—with a complete viciousness. I don’t know how else to explain it, as if it would be dangerous for her to look at you.<br> “Was she enjoying the paintings, I asked, and she said, ‘Oh, no, not at all.’ She didn’t even turn to see where the question had come from. I asked if she was a collector, or an artist herself, or…? But she didn’t answer, just paced around … Eventually, she asked if I was the one to blame for these paintings. I told her that I was indeed the gallerist here, and she turned to me for the first time and said, ‘I’m so sorry to hear that,’ then launched into this explanation about how terrible the work was, how the artist had no understanding of color or dimensionality or texture, that he was indulgent, that he had no ideas, that the paintings documented his every missed opportunity. She said—‘He didn’t put anything in the paintings because he doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know anything about art, and worse, he doesn’t care.’ Now, of course I was accustomed to criticism—I even welcomed it on occasion—but no one’s opinion ever made me as doubtful as hers. Ah! Then she said this one thing I’ve thought of many times since—‘You have to know what you’re leaving out in order for it not to be there. Otherwise, it’s not an absence, it’s just nothing.’ And immediately I had a better understanding of all those void artists back then—there were so many of them. Anyway, I sent the desk boy home early, and eventually this woman said her name was Věra, and I asked her how it was she’d come to her opinions about art. ‘Oh, they’re not opinions,</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R726" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">727</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Biography of X</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Catherine Lacey</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-04-18 13:45:48</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr"><br> “I knew the ash wasn’t exactly good, but it seemed clever enough and simple; it would sell. But somehow Věra knew all about that man—she even knew about the ash! Absolutely hated it, she said, then went on and on about how pathetic his work was in general. In five minutes she’d described the entire sweep of art history, from the ancient to the contemporary, and by the end of it I had this knot in my stomach. It was far too late to cancel the show, and collectors were already lining up, but she had seen straight through the whole thing. When she was done she left immediately, as if she was too disgusted to stay another moment. Later I asked the ash guy if he’d ever heard of someone named Věra, but he said he hadn’t. A few weeks later she stopped by again, sneering and laughing at the pile of ash, but this time I convinced her to come with me to a bar around the corner—I was still trying to figure out who she was, of course, but also I couldn’t stand to be in the room with that pile of ash after she’d embarrassed me so much over it.<br> “I’d never met anyone in New York less willing to talk about herself—still haven’t—but after a few glasses of wine that afternoon I finally got some details from her—that she was an artist, but she’d only exhibited abroad, that she didn’t respect any New York galleries, and I found myself almost begging her to show me her work—mind you, I’d never begged anyone for anything, and certainly not an artist, as they were constantly presenting their own severed heads on a platter at my feet, desperate for my attention, but that was the thing about her—she may have been a con artist, but the con was always honest.”<br> That evening X, known in that moment as “Věra,” agreed to accompany Ginny to a few openings, and while X’s refusal to show Ginny any of her own work may have seemed like a tactic to string along her interest, in truth X had no work to show. “It was at least a year before she agreed to let me see anything, long after I’d stopped asking,” Ginny said.<br> The first pieces that Věra exhibited with Quarry, in early 1979, were allegedly documentations of performances she’d done in years prior, but in fact X had only produced all this “performance documentation” months after she inserted herself into Ginny’s world, a simple fact Ginny Green refuses to accept.<br> “I understand that Věra was a pseudonym, a made-up person, but the work was simply the work. She didn’t lie about it—she couldn’t have.”<br> When I told her I had proof if she needed proof, Ginny changed the subject.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R727" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">728</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">annotation</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Biography of X</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Catherine Lacey</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-04-18 13:47:44</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Continuation d’un chemin de bois pour aller d’un lieu à un autre dans le but d’une quelconque communication (Continuation of a wooden path in order to go from one place to another with the aim of making any kind of communication),</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R728" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">729</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Biography of X</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Catherine Lacey</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-04-18 13:48:41</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Both the title and content were a verbatim copy of a 1970 performance by the artist Gina Pane.

We looked down at them for a while, quiet, casting our eyes across the three-frame story as it repeated in different settings, with different men, and different expressions of disgust.<br> At the time of this interview, I’d just read about the 1975 famine in the Southern Territory, which had been covered only by the smaller newspapers, for reasons I do not understand. When the South seceded in 1945, all environmental regulations had been lifted on the biblical grounds of men having “dominion over the earth,” but by the mid-1970s three decades of an unbroken hunting season and heedless pollution had nearly eradicated wild game and forage. Drought, crop failure, and a strict trade embargo meant the families who best survived those years had ways of catching the rats, squirrels, and feral cats. But X never responded to the critique that her work seemed to be apolitical for never directly referencing the country’s division; nearly every other successful artist in the Northern Territory at the time seemed obliged at some point to make work as a statement about the wall, and the fact that X never did so was often cited as evidence of her heartlessness and frivolity.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R731" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">732</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Biography of X</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Catherine Lacey</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-04-18 13:57:14</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">I don’t think so.

He noticed that other medical pioneers such as Louis Pasteur had reported similar findings with erysipelas and began to suspect that postsurgical infections in some cases actually helped patients recover from cancer. Coley hypothesized that the infections triggered an immune response that not only ridded the body of the invading bacteria, as a fever is intended to do, but also stimulated the body’s immune system to attack the cancer cells.<br> Coley immediately tested his theory on a cancer patient on whom all other treatments had failed, injecting him directly with live streptococcus bacteria. The man, who had a tumor the size of a chicken egg on his neck, could barely speak or swallow and had been given only weeks to live. After the injection, his fever flared and he grew alarmingly ill. But then, as he recovered from the infection, he and Coley watched the tumor dissolve and disappear. The man survived and went home cancer-free.<br> The implications were astounding—somehow, the body’s natural processes of fighting infection were also breaking down cancerous tumors, liquefying and flushing them away as if they’d never been there.<br> Rereading the story of Dr. Coley and Bessie Dashiell, I was struck by the visionary nature of his discoveries, so long ago. Coley, now called “the father of immunotherapy,” uncovered something essential about the power of the human immune system—a way to potentially turn it on to fight an incurable illness.

The death rate from childbed fever immediately plummeted from a soaring high of close to 25 percent down to only 1 to 2 percent.<br> It was a dramatic and undeniable success. But the medical world couldn’t, or wouldn’t, accept the theory that diseases were spread in this way. First of all, the notion that doctors carried some kind of infectious substance on their hands was laughed off as utter nonsense—to think there were tiny, invisible creatures covering surfaces and flying through the air spreading illness seemed absurd. And second, the idea that doctors had been responsible for their patients’ suffering and death all along was impossible to believe, anathema to the image of physicians as saviors. “Doctors are gentlemen,” said one prominent Philadelphia physician, “and a gentleman’s hands are clean.”<br> Semmelweis was mocked and threatened and eventually run out of the medical profession entirely. He reportedly took to stopping pregnant women in the street and urging them to “make sure your doctor washes his hands.” Judged insane, he was committed to a psychiatric institution, where he died—quite possibly of the very same strain of sepsis that had once killed so many of his female patients.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R778" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">779</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Cured</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jeff Rediger</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-08-10 08:57:17</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">It seemed we had unlocked the secret to health: kill the germ.<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R779" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">780</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Cured</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jeff Rediger</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-08-10 08:57:25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">He believed that most microorganisms that lived in, on, and around the human body were beneficial, even symbiotic.

A few times this resulted in someone calling me Ann after they’d misheard the “and,” so for a year at Girl Scouts I was Ann. What’s more—my last name is my mother’s pure invention, her attempt to get away from her own family, whose last name I have never known, but my father won the first-name argument in the end, and Charlotte Marie was made my legal name, though my mother still called me Cindy and both my brothers called me Malone, Mally, or Loner. Since there were too many Charlottes in my third-grade class, a teacher started calling me Marie and that stuck for a while and I didn’t mind. In college I was Charlotte again, by default of roll call, but some people in journalism school called me Lucca—as most of us had adopted the newsroom affectation of calling people by their surnames. When I began publishing I used C. M. Lucca, and though I’d only intended for “C. M.” to appear in print, most of my colleagues started calling me C. M. Henry had the bizarre habit of calling me Char, which wasn’t a name at all but something you do to a piece of dead flesh, but I accepted this name, too, for no reason other than I had no preferred alternative. X didn’t call me anything at first, or if she did I don’t remember what she called me—“Henry Surner’s wife,” perhaps, as a joke—so when Ginny began to call me C and X followed suit, it ultimately felt fine, as it seems I was born under a nameless moon and perhaps that namelessness was what X had been drawn to from the start: I was a house without a foundation.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R804" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">805</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Biography of X</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Catherine Lacey</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-08-11 23:40:49</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Calle claimed she never knew she was being followed, and refused to speak of it in interviews. “It’s her work,” Calle sometimes said, “not mine to speak on.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R805" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">806</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Biography of X</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Catherine Lacey</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-08-12 00:36:21</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">She often left such questions answered;</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R806" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">807</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Biography of X</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Catherine Lacey</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-08-12 00:41:20</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">At some point offendability moved its offices to the hip side of town,</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R807" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">808</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Biography of X</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Catherine Lacey</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-08-12 05:01:49</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">she had my life and I had a home.<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R808" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">809</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Wild</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Cheryl Strayed</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-08-12 19:44:41</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr"><br> There was nothing much to say.

If my dad was a warrior then Mike was a poet-philosopher. Their differences can probably be best summarized by this: When assessing the clients they led up mountains, if the group had a get-to-the-top-or-bust vibe, then my dad would lead the group. If they seemed more into the experiential nature of the endeavor and the peak was a bonus, then Mike led them. Mike took a slow and meditative, stop-and-smell-roses kind of approach. It never seemed to bother him that he hadn’t climbed the area’s most iconic wall, the east face of Longs Peak—even though many considered it a “must-do,” in terms of status in the climbing community.

After all, in addition to having more fun, those who could combine new-school skills with a big-route mind-set might just change the game entirely. His sense of inclusiveness was deeply influential as I grew older and met more and more climbers. I’d see people doing things differently from me, and instead of dismissing them and their efforts out of hand, I’d try to learn, try to add to my own bag of tricks.

I was nineteen, had recently graduated from high school, and had little interest in university. Back in Colorado I took the first step to enroll at the local community college, but the moment I set foot on the campus, it was as if I was zipped up in bivvy sack of anxiety and frustration. What about all those dreams I’d had of travel and not conforming to the usual expectations?<br>			 One evening around the dinner table I stared down at my hands, fumbling with how to begin.<br>			 My mom slid her hand across the table and took mine in hers, “You know you don’t have to go to college right now, right?”<br>			 I looked up at her. I hated the idea of worrying her, and in that moment I saw that she looked hopeful.<br>			 “Listen,” my dad began, “school will always be there for you when you really want it.”<br>			 I almost laughed. It was as if he’d read the mental script I’d prepared earlier that day.<br>			 “If you want,” my mom said, her eyes shining and her mouth twitching into a poorly hidden smirk, “you can ditch your dad and me for a year and hit the road.”<br>			 “You’d be on your own,” my dad said. His expression turned serious. “But there’ve got to be a few things we make clear.”<br>			 The few things were truly a small number. This was to be a reality check for me. I could raid the pantry to start out and whenever I came back through Estes. Other than that, no financial support. Though he didn’t say this, I sensed that my dad wanted me to experience the dirtbag life. I also think he thought that I might enjoy it. As usual, he was right. Funny thing was, I’d been wondering for a while if getting some space from him would help me find the direction I needed. My mom and he had been thinking along the same lines.<br>			 Within a day or two I replaced the passenger seat in my car with a piece of plywood for a bed and hit the road. Where to?<br>			 When in doubt, go with what you know.<br>			 I traveled from one sport climbing area to the next, checking off a few routes I hadn’t sent on previous trips. I continued attending competitions, usually placing in the top three, but almost never winning. After entry fees, the prize money typically left me with about a hundred bucks a month, enough to keep climbing and going to comps. I showered maybe twice a month at YMCAs, and spent my rest days at public libraries and dollar movie theaters. I shopped at dented can and expired food stores, and even did a bit of Dumpster diving.

I had enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of climbing for my whole career; now I had a new problem to face. For example, pinch holds were exceptionally difficult, so I compensated by strengthening my shoulders—now, rather than pinching holds, I could place my fingers on the inside of the hold and push outward with great force. The loss of the finger wasn’t as crippling as it might have seemed to outsiders because often on the harder climbs, the holds are too small to grab with all four fingers anyway. I excelled on these smaller holds—the two- or three-finger holds—because that’s all I had on my left hand. I’d always thought of vertical climbing as a kind of dance, while overhanging climbing is more of a wrestling match.

That didn’t apply to me anymore, so I made plans to return to Patagonia with Josh “Safety Fifth” Wharton, so named because of his penchant for climbing huge, committing routes with no first-aid kit, no bivvy gear, and no margin for error. He’d made blisteringly fast first ascents all around the world. Wharton and another friend, “Sketchy Kelly,” had gone two days without food and water at 20,000 feet on a climb in Pakistan’s Karakoram mountains after accidentally dropping a good portion of their gear. They dubbed their approach Disaster Style. While that’s a darkly humorous term for full-commitment climbing in big mountains, it also works in life. Just then, for me, that was the great thing about feeling empty: When you’ve got nothing to lose, it’s no longer a disaster.<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R866" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">867</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Push</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Tommy Caldwell</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-08-17 08:11:43</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Our plan was to go super light on a 4,000-foot big wall on the space-needle-shaped Cerro Torre.

In the company of others, I tried harder and began to link big sections. The climbing felt easier. I even seemed to see better. One day I noticed an inconspicuous line of holds around one of the most troubling sections. More inspection revealed a miraculous sequence of edges, some only a millimeter thick, continuing for two hundred feet. The next day I came close to sticking a crazy eight-foot dyno—basically, an all-points-off jump from one hold to another—across a span of featureless rock. It’s an incredibly rare technique on big routes, and one of the times when climbing actually does look like the stuff you see in Cliffhanger.

What if Kevin viewed me as the overbearing father?<br>			 In one way, though, Kevin and my dad were alike. My dad was always acutely aware of what a rare opportunity I had—to make a living doing what I loved. At times, though, he seemed more willing (or able) to talk with me about my professional life than about how I was doing inside. After Kyrgyzstan, for example, I felt as if he was at least as concerned about my climbing as he was about my well-being.<br>			 Then again, these things overlap with me, and I probably needed the direction. Or the push. I wasn’t driven by money, and I don’t think he was either, but making money was the means by which I could continue to do what made me happiest for as long as possible. Certainly, if given the choice, my dad would have loved to have been a full-time climber.<br>			 My dad—like Kevin, probably—understood better than I did that idealism had to be grounded in the more mundane realities of rents and mortgages, utility bills, and car maintenance. Maybe, if I looked at things more from his and Kevin’s point of view, I’d better appreciate the positive aspect to their more multidimensional approach: Climbing could also be a career.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R893" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">894</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Push</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Tommy Caldwell</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-08-17 09:21:42</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">had never known love could be so joyful.

The way the clouds took on the shapes of zoo animals. We rigged a harness to bungee cords and hung it from a branch; Fitz would bounce around like a jolly little elf while we bouldered and climbed. We would set him in our piles of ropes and climbing gear and he would use the carabiners as teething rings. Sometimes in the evening, when the campfire smoke hung low in the campground, we would bathe Fitz in a little pink dishwashing basin. His wide green eyes seemed full of wonder and innocence.

After dropping him off at school, I suddenly realized that I hadn’t taken my name tag off my dirty scrubs. Groaning, I turned back around, knowing I’d be late for the morning meeting, but also knowing that Travis would make me go back home to get it anyway.

My breath caught in my throat as I looked at the damage, which was severe, but would have been much worse if the car that had been hit wasn’t so sturdy. That could have been me and it could have killed me, I thought. Thankfully, it looked like all parties were out of their cars and walking around.

I put myself in my patient’s or their caregiver’s shoes; I put myself in the shoes of people like Will. I felt their pain, I felt their loss, and it affected me deeply. To be honest, I think this ability to feel what other people are feeling is part of what makes me a good nurse, and especially a good hospice nurse. But it also takes a personal toll, and I’m sure it’s one of the reasons why nurses experience so many mental health challenges and don’t last for long in the field. In fact, only one out of every four hospice nurses makes it beyond five years, from what I’ve heard.<br>			 Empathy, on the other hand, is the ability to feel for a person and their situation without being personally affected by it. Empathy allows me to be present and compassionate without taking on a situation as my own, and it has allowed me to continue being a good nurse without burning out or engaging in the dark humor that so many people in my profession do, for their own sanity.

That whole month, while I complained about the effects of an accident I had created, I kept thinking about the many people who take these drugs every day. Not for a month but forever. Not everyone gets sick from the antiviral drugs, but many do. There are those out there who have trouble not just with the side effects but also finding a drug combination that will bring their virus under control. Even worse are the millions who are infected but have no access to the lifesaving drugs I complained about having to take. This book tells the story of how we have developed a cure but also what we still need to do to bring it to the 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1026" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1027</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Cured</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Nathalia Holt</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-08-31 05:37:58</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Viruses are unique in the disease world for their ability to live within us without causing disease.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1027" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1028</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">annotation</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Cured</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Nathalia Holt</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-08-31 05:38:28</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">. A sterilizing cure is just what it sounds like: It “sterilizes” the body. This means that no trace of the virus can be found. A functional cure, on the other hand, doesn’t get rid of all traces of the pathogen. But a cure of either type means that the person does not require medication or therapy. Both types of cure mean a person doesn’t have to worry about the virus growing in his body or destroying her immune system. It is also highly unlikely that the person could infect anyone else.<br>			 In people with a functional cure, lying hidden in their bodies, detectable only by the most sensitive tests, will be traces of the virus. Persons receiving this treatment are cured, but they will always carry a small piece of the virus with them. For most, it doesn’t matter if the cure they receive is sterilizing or functional; they simply want to be cured. Both Berlin patients received a functional cure for HIV, which is to say they both still carry the virus inside them and always will. This may sound like a strange cure, but it isn’t.

It is a kind of viral Trojan horse. It is “retro” because it reproduces itself in a way that’s backward from how most life-forms manage this wonderful trick. In the nucleus of each cell in our body, and we have an awful lot of them, the genetic recipe for building our entire body can be found. Every cell has the complete list of instructions. Those genes are packed in DNA, tightly coiled molecules of nucleic acids. To make use of all the instructions in our genes, certain enzymes unwind the DNA helix in the cell’s nucleus. But to ensure that the precious DNA is not lost, another enzyme swoops in and makes a copy of the DNA needed. This is called transcription. This copy is made literally backward and has a few special alterations. (One of these alterations is to a base called uracil, a molecule whose origin may be extraterrestrial—yes, really.) The copy is called ribonucleic acid, or RNA. The RNA blueprint is then transported from the nucleus to a ribosome, which, once it gets its hands on the RNA, translates the backward code and makes proteins from the blueprint.<br>			 DNA  RNA  Protein <br>			 Simple as one, two, three. For decades, this definition of the process, made by Francis Crick, the codiscoverer of DNA with James Watson, was considered scientific dogma. That is how life works. So imagine how surprising it was when scientists discovered that a virus could run in the opposite direction. Retroviruses forced scientists to question what defines life. Here was an organism with a genetic code of its own but with no cell to house it. Can you be alive if you hold the blueprint to life but have to borrow the construction plant from another organism? Can there be life outside a cell? Taxonomists have spent decades debating this, perhaps pointlessly. As Carl Zimmer argues in A Planet of Viruses, “Trying to find a moment in time when such RNA-life abruptly became ‘alive’ just distracts us from the gradual transition to life as we know it.”<br>			 This is what retroviruses do. They trick our cells into making the proteins they need, as directed from their RNA. Instead of starting with DNA, HIV holds all its genetic information as RNA. The virus exists as two simple strands of RNA packaged into a spiky protein shell containing all the enzymes it needs.

These two, Walker was told, “were doing really important work” and couldn’t be distracted. If it sounds childish for lab members to be told not to speak to one another, imagine how it feels for a new researcher trying to gain a foothold in the field. As odd as it may sound, labs like this exist today. Even worse, many high-powered labs take the situation a step further, pitting their lab members against one another, each junior researcher in a battle to get the data first for the sole purpose of putting his or her name at the top of a manuscript. For Walker, it was tough. While he appreciated his mentors, he felt lost at sea. There was little supervision. He had no one to ask for help. The lab environment was tense. None of Walker’s experiments were working.

But, with persistence and experience, some will succeed. Part of maturing as a scientist is recognizing these moments, understanding when to pack it in and when to keep going. Walker, at the very beginning of his career, wasn’t sure which to do. Morose, he sat looking over the botched data. Joe Sodroski, the researcher he wasn’t supposed to disturb, came up to him. “What are you working on?” Sodroski asked, concerned about Walker’s despondent attitude. Walker told Sodroski what he was trying to do and how nothing was working. Much to his surprise, Sodroski had the solution.<br>			 Using Sodroski’s suggestions, Walker was able to get a unique model for HIV up and running. From their conversation, he devised an artificial system in which B cells taken from patients are engineered to express individual parts of HIV. He then measured the ability of killer T cells, the storm troopers, to respond specifically to each piece. With this scheme, he was able to dissect the components of the T cell response to the virus, teasing out which parts of HIV initiate a response. Taking the storm trooper cells from their first HIV patient, Walker’s team was excited to finally measure how the body responded to HIV. What they found was dramatic. In people infected with HIV, their storm trooper T cells specifically target and kill HIV-infected cells. These killer cells knew who or what they were looking for. When storm trooper cells were taken from people not infected with the HIV virus, the cells did not know what they were looking for. This data was the first indication that the body can mount a specific response to HIV.<br>			 Walker’s advisor knew this would be a big paper.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1054" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1055</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Cured</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Nathalia Holt</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-08-31 21:30:25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">The more original a discovery, the more obvious it seems afterwards.<br>			 —Arthur Koestler, The Act of Creation<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1055" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1056</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Cured</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Nathalia Holt</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-08-31 22:17:05</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">In Dubai he left behind old regrets and began dating someone new.

To overcome this problem, the bacterium uses time to help it deal with space. The cell is not interested in how much of a chemical is present at any given moment, but rather in whether that concentration is increasing or decreasing. After all, if the cell swam in a straight line simply because the concentration of a desirable chemical was high, it might travel away from chemical nirvana, not toward it, depending on the direction it’s pointing. The bacterium solves this problem in an ingenious manner: as it senses its world, one mechanism registers what conditions are like right now, and another records how things were a few moments ago. The bacterium will swim in a straight line as long as the chemicals it senses seem better now than those it sensed a moment ago. If not, it’s preferable to change course.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1160" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1161</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">annotation</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Other Minds</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Peter Godfrey-Smith</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-04 19:45:45</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Much of the use of light by single-celled organisms is for solar power; like plants, they sunbathe.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1161" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1162</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Other Minds</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Peter Godfrey-Smith</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-04 19:46:45</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Much of the sensing done by these tiny organisms is aimed at finding food and avoiding toxins. Even in the earliest work on E. coli, though, it seemed that something else was going on. They were also attracted to chemicals they could not eat. Biologists who work on these organisms are more and more inclined to see the senses of bacteria as attuned to the presence and activities of other cells around them, not just to washes of edible and inedible chemicals. The receptors on the surfaces of bacterial cells are sensitive to many things, and these include chemicals that bacteria themselves tend to excrete for various reasons—sometimes just as overflow of metabolic processes. This may not sound like much, but it opens an important door. Once the same chemicals are being sensed and produced, there is the possibility of coordination between cells. We have reached the birth of social behavior.<br> An example is quorum sensing. If a chemical is both produced and sensed by a particular kind of bacterium, it can be used by those bacteria to assess how many individuals of the same kind are around. By doing this, they can work out whether enough bacteria are nearby for it to be worthwhile to produce a chemical that does its job only if many cells make it at once.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1162" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1163</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">Nell Gwynne&#39;s On Land and At Sea</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Kage Baker</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-04 20:42:18</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Closer in, the prosperous had moored their yachts, and on each deck was a nearly identical tableau: an industrialist or peer dressed in nautical whites was taking tea in the open air.

Observing the angle of the sunset, she turned in such a way as to allow the streaming golden light to display her charms to their greatest advantage. With wide eyes and parted lips, she gazed upon Mr. Pickett as though he were the hero of her dreams. It had its due effect on Mr. Pickett, who gulped, lurched forward under the irresistible influence of her beauty, and bent her backward in a kiss.<br> The embrace went on for some time, so it was fortunate that the garden was, as mentioned before, quite a private one. The object of Mr. Pickett’s attentions neither screamed, struggled nor made any creditable attempt to resist him, and it was only his own sense of propriety which called a halt to the proceedings.<br> “Why—why, my dear Miss Beatrice, what must you think of me?” he said, gasping for breath. “I do humbly beg your pardon! I’ll go down on my knees if you but ask. Only spare a poor mortal overcome by your radiant beauty!”<br> Lady Beatrice favored him with an expression that managed to convey the trepidation of a wounded fawn mixed with passionate adoration. She had learned to avoid the instinctive movements of quickly smoothing her garments, rearranging her décolletage, and tucking her hair back into place; a single forlornly dangling tress had the power to break hearts when properly presented. “Oh, Mr. Pickett—dear Mr. Pickett—how can I tell you what I feel? But we must speak of this occurrence no further!” She raised her hands to her face, as in dismay. “And only think! Poor Mamma sleeps within.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1169" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1170</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">Nell Gwynne&#39;s On Land and At Sea</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Kage Baker</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-04 22:23:05</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr"><br> Mrs. Otley pointed at this last item and said defensively, “I’m quite sure that this is an archaic feature.”<br> “Perhaps you found a Druid’s head,” suggested Miss Rendlesham.<br> “What a horrid thought!” said Maude.<br> “Not to one of a scientific mind,” retorted Mrs. Otley. “I shall make a drawing of it and send it to Mr. Darwin.

So much for finding out who’s going to win in the fifth race at Santa Anita on April 1, 2375.<br> Still, Dr. Zeus played around with the field and discovered what could at first be taken as a comforting fact: History cannot be changed. You can’t go back and save Lincoln, but neither can you erase your own present by accidentally killing one of your ancestors. To repeat, history cannot be changed.<br> However—and listen closely, this is the important part—this law can only be observed to apply to recorded history.

If history states that John Jones won a million dollars in the lottery on a certain day in the past, you can’t go back there and win the lottery instead. But you can make sure that John Jones is an agent of yours, who will purchase the winning ticket on that day and dutifully invest the proceeds for you.

Getting a boat to move requires the coordination of micro-actions, but someone also needs to watch where the boat is going.

Through much of the twentieth century, a sensory-motor view of the evolution of nervous systems was simply assumed, and it took some time for the second view, the one based on internal coordination, to become clear. Chris Pantin, an English biologist, developed the second view in the 1950s and it has been revived recently by Fred Keijzer, a philosopher. They rightly point out that it’s easy to fall into the habit of thinking of each “action” as a single unit, in which case the only problem left to solve is coordinating these acts with the senses, working out when to do X rather than Y. As organisms get bigger and can do more, that picture becomes more and more inaccurate. It ignores the problem of how an organism is able to do X or Y in the first place.

He pressed his finger to it and the noise stopped. Then, on an impulse, he sank his hand into the burned forest litter, lifted it and let the coarse mixture sift slowly through his fingers. “It’s hot out, Prosper,” Ngonda said. “Do you really need to be playing in the dirt?” The litter looked real enough: charred and broken twigs, clumps of leaf mold, wood cinders and a delicate ruined hemlock cone. But it didn’t feel right. He squeezed a scrap of burned bark, expecting it to crumble. Instead it compacted into an irregular pellet, like day-old bread. When he released it, the pellet slowly resumed its original shape. “It’s not real,” said Spur. “None of it.” “It’s a memorial, Prosper.” The deputy offered Spur a hand and pulled him to his feet. “People need to remember.” He bent over to brush at the fake pine needles stuck to Spur’s knees. “We need to </td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1218" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1219</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">Nebula Awards Showcase 2008</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Ben Bova</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-06 17:57:53</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Just then Spur got a particularly intense whiff of something that was acrid and sooty, but not quite smoke. It was what he had first smelled as the train had pulled into the Memorial. He turned in a complete circle, all senses heightened, trying to pinpoint the source. After fire ran through the litter of leaves and twigs that covered the forest floor, it often sank into the duff, the layer of decomposing organic matter that lay just above the soil level. Since duff was like a sponge, most of the year it was too wet to burn. But in the heat of summer it could dry out and became tinder. Spur had seen a smoldering fire burrow through the layer of duff and emerge dozens of meters away. He sniffed, following his nose to a charred stump. “Prosper!” said Ngonda. “What are you doing?” Spur heard a soft hiss as he crouched beside the stump. It wasn’t any fire sound that he knew, but he instinctively ran his bare hand across the stump, feeling for hotspots. Something cool and wet sprayed onto his fingers and he jerked them back as if he had been burned. He rubbed a smutty liquid between thumb and forefinger and then smelled it. It had an evil, manmade odor of extinguished fire. Spur sat back on his heels, puzzled. Why would anyone want to mimic that particular stink? Then he realized that his hand was clean when it ought to have been smudged with soot from the stump. He rubbed hard against the burned wood, but the black refused to come off. He could see now that the stump had a clear finish, as if it had been coated with a preservative. Spur could sense Ngonda’s shadow loom over him but then he heard the hissing again and was able to pick out the tiny nozzle embedded in</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1219" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1220</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">Nebula Awards Showcase 2008</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Ben Bova</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-06 18:05:00</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">But I shook with you already.” He tugged at Ngonda’s sleeve to move him aside. “You have hardly any luck left, friend Constant.

When he was eighteen, he began attending classes at the hortischool extension in Longwalk, very much against GiGo’s wishes. He had paid tuition out of money earned doing odd jobs around the village—another pointless diversion from home chores that irritated his parents. Cape had become interested in fruit trees after brown rot spoiled almost the entire crop of Littleton’s sour cherries the year before. All the farmers in the village raised fruit, but their orchards were usually no more than a dozen trees, all of traditional heirloom varieties. Crops were small, usually just enough for home use because of the ravages of pests and disease. Farmers battled Terran immigrants like tarnished plant bugs, sawflies, wooly aphids, coddling moths, leafrollers, lesser apple worms, and the arch enemy: plum curculio. There were mildews, rusts, rots, cankers, blotches and blights to contend with as well. The long growing season of fruit trees made them vulnerable to successive attacks. Citizens across the Transcendent State debated whether or not Chairman Winter had introduced insect evil and fungal disease into his new Garden of Eden on purpose. The question had never been settled. But at hortischool, Cape learned about neem spray, extracted from the chinaberry tree, and the organic insecticide pyrethrum, which was made from dried daisies. And he heard about an amazing cider apple called Huang’s Nectar, a disease-resistant early bloomer, well-suited to the climate of Southeast but not yet proven hardy in the north. As much to spite his father as to test the new variety, he had drained his savings and bought a dozen saplings on w4 semi-dwarfing rootstock. He started his own orchard on land he had cleared near his hut. Two years later, he brought in his first—admittedly light—harvest, which nevertheless yielded the sweetest cider and smoothest applejack anyone in Littleton had ever tasted. Cape purchased a handscrew press in his third year and switched from fermenting his cider in glass carboys to huge oak barrels by his fifth. And he bought more apple trees—he never seemed to have enough: McIntosh, GoRed, Jay’s Pippin, Alumar Gold, Adam and Eve. Soon he began to grow rootstock and sell trees to other farmers. By the time Cape married Spur’s mother, the Leungs were renting land from farmsteads on either side of their original holding.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1226" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1227</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">Nebula Awards Showcase 2008</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Ben Bova</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-06 18:48:10</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Then Spur remembered that Sly had said he had heard something.

A little history first, just so we’re all on the same page. In 1956, Damon Knight, Judith Merril, and James Blish founded a series of conferences in Milford, Pennsylvania. Not at all like fan-oriented conventions, the Milford Conferences were pro only, with both established writers and newer ones. Those present represented a significant fraction of the working SF/fantasy fields at the time, arguably the cream of the stfnal (scientifictional) crop: the three principals, of course, and Katherine McLean, Algis Budrys, Arthur Clarke, Anthony Boucher, Cyril Kornbluth, Theodore Sturgeon, Fritz Leiber, Lester and Evelyn del Rey, Robert Silverberg, and Harlan Ellison all attending in the early days, exchanging ideas and criticizing each other’s work. Kate Wilhelm, not yet then married to Knight, describes it as being “a meeting of peers, no chiefs [or] Indians, just writers critiquing one another’s stories. It never changed that format. Critiques early in the day, dinner, then discussions on set topics in the late hours.” In fact, it’s not too much of a stretch to say that, whereas the process of elevating SF (aka the “New Wave”) to a supposed level of capital-L </td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1241" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1242</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">Nebula Awards Showcase 2008</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Ben Bova</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-06 20:34:45</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">.” As indeed it did, as we shall see.

Cooler temperatures, calmer air, less ambient noise from insects (and traffic), allow a bird’s song to travel farther, the better to stake its territory—at least in northern species—or to broadcast its presence to prospective mates. Or maybe it’s that predators are less of a threat. Or maybe the birds are up anyway, and the low light makes foraging difficult, the still air not suitable for migrating, and insects not yet out and about. So why not sing?

It’s a process of imitating and practicing called vocal learning, and it’s extremely rare in the animal world. Vocal learning in birds begins early, just as it does in humans. By the last trimester of pregnancy, a human fetus can memorize what it hears from the external world and is especially sensitive to melody in both music and language. This appears to be true for some birds, too. The embryos of certain species can hear through the shell of the egg; in response to the voice of a parent, their heart rate increases. As a defense against brood parasites, superb fairy-wrens learn special vocal passwords from their parents when they’re still in the egg. Scientists have found that at least five days before they hatch, the unborn fairy-wren chicks learn to imitate the call. Zebra finch parents can tell their young while they’re still developing in the egg that it’s hot outside. This is vital information for a growing chick. In hot climates, birds need to be able to lose heat, which is easier with a smaller body. When zebra finch parents are breeding in a hot climate, and the nest hits a temperature above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, they’ll chirp the news to their unborn chicks in the last third of the incubation period—the moment when the embryos are developing their temperature-regulation system. In response to these “hot calls,” the chicks will actually curtail their growth and emerge smaller—an adaptive advantage in the heat.<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1286" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1287</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-08 00:43:06</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">One small bird that coexists with the bell miner by keeping a low profile has its own notable vocal talent, used for an entirely different purpose.

The distinctive and enchanting two-note “whipcrack” call, a kind of thin whistled whoooopp capped by a sudden, loud chew, chew! is actually a duet, male and female singing in a call-and-response so precisely timed and seamlessly delivered it sounds like one bird calling.

The temperate regions such as North America and Europe, where duetting is rare, and female song in general is less common, are the regions that host a lot of migrants. “It’s the migratory birds that have lost female song,” explains Langmore, who was part of the study. “Migrants have a very different pattern of territoriality and pairing than in the tropics. Typically, the male will arrive on the breeding grounds singing his head off, and the females will fly in and listen, and they’ll plunk down on the chosen male’s territory. Then they’ll have a very short breeding season. They just go for it like crazy, and then they leave.”<br>			 Resident birds, on the other hand, like those in the tropics, have to defend their territory all year long. If, over the years, a partner dies, the remaining bird has to be able to defend that territory and attract a new mate. “And there can be divorce, as well,” says Langmore. “Whichever bird is left has to be able to sing to defend its territory or attract a new mate.

In human speech, words referring to a specific object usually evoke a visual mental image. Think moon or dog or snake. Suzuki found evidence that Japanese tit alarm calls create just this kind of search image in the heads of listening birds. The tit’s jar call causes the birds to search for snakes and to become more visually responsive to any object resembling a snake.

Predators are a big problem for these birds. During their first winter of life, more than a third are taken by owls, pine martens, sparrowhawks, and especially goshawks, which account for 70 percent of all kills. Goshawks hunt in three phases—perching in a tree and scanning for prey, making search flights to the next perch, where they scan some more, and then, finally, bulleting through the brush to take their prey by surprise. The jays have evolved a sophisticated system of three different alarm calls specifying the hunting phase of the hawk—whether it’s perched, searching for prey, or attacking.<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1295" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1296</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-08 05:56:24</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">The chickadee-dee-dee mobbing alarm calls of black-capped chickadees contain messages—coded in the number of dees at the end of the call—about the size of a predator and hence, the degree of threat it represents.

She calls him Triple Blue and he sings especially beautifully, “a truly astounding free-flowing improvisation full of loud, flamboyant mimicry,” she says. “For lyrebirds, the evidence is strong that mimicry in males is sexually selected.” Belting out mimicry to females he can’t see is a male’s way of advertising himself, saying, “Look how clever I am, how accurate and versatile my mimicry is, how strong is my voice. I’m very intelligent (the accuracy of my mimicry shows that I have a good brain), and I can sing for hours a day.” As Dalziell points out, the female alone sees to all the parental care—building the nest, brooding and raising the chick, defending her feeding territory. All she needs from a male is sperm. A choosy female measures a prospective mate by his spectacular plumage, his dancing ability, and his loud, complex, flamboyant song, including the versatility and accuracy of his mimicry and the carrying capacity of his calls. All of these traits may act as “honest” signals of a male’s quality—his ability to learn, his strength and vigor, his genes, the conditions in which he was raised. “It’s probably good for females to mate with males that are proficient vocal mimics so that their offspring are also competent at using mimicry to defend nests if they’re female and to obtain mates if they’re male,” says Dalziell. A female will listen to various males for months and months before she settles on a mate. Only the best performers get to pass on their genes. Hence, a smart, high-performing bird species gets smarter, better at mimicking, at dancing, and at growing gorgeous tail feathers.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1303" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1304</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">Un caballero en Moscú</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Amor Towles</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-08 21:07:07</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Sin profesión conocida pese a estar ya en la treintena, se ha dedicado con auténtica pasión a los placeres de la lectura y de la buena mesa.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1304" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1305</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">Un caballero en Moscú</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Amor Towles</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-08 21:16:56</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">mil ochocientos ochenta y nueve.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1305" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1306</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">Un caballero en Moscú</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Amor Towles</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-08 21:26:42</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">: No era ningún cumplido.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1306" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1307</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-09 16:57:06</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">A pair of currawongs will catch about 4.5 pounds of small nestlings, which comes out to about forty broods, to raise a single brood of its own. </td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1307" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1308</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-09 16:58:45</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">.

The truth is, those naked heads relieved of adornment are extremely hygienic—gory stuff just doesn’t stick. And it’s a lie that vultures particularly relish a ripe, rotting mess. They actually prefer fresher carrion. As such, they perform a vital, and vastly underrated, service to the environment: the quick, competent cleanup and recycling of dead creatures.<br>			 Vultures are nature’s sanitary workers. Because they feed in groups and eat rapidly—each bird downing more than two pounds of meat a minute—they can rapidly consume whole carcasses. Their guts are acidic enough to destroy the agents of disease, such as cholera and anthrax, so there’s little risk of spreading contamination from an infected carcass. That’s not the case with more leisurely mammalian carrion eaters such as rats or dogs or coyotes.<br>			 What happens when vultures vanish, people learned the hard way in India and Pakistan more than a decade ago. There, a mass die-off of old-world vultures caused by an arthritis drug in the flesh of dead cattle led to an eruption of rabies.

They see hues beyond our imagining. Humans have three types of color-receptive cones in our retinas, blue, green, and red. Birds have a fourth color cone that is sensitive to ultraviolet wavelengths. We are thus “trichromatic,” and most diurnal birds are “tetrachromatic.” With their extra UV cone, birds can distinguish shades of color we can’t tell apart, allowing them to spot prey well camouflaged against the uniform background of a grassy field or leafy forest floor, and to detect things invisible to us—like the trail of urine left by a vole.<br>			 But it goes beyond this. Birds see a massive spectrum of color our brains are simply incapable of processing. “It’s not just that they can see wavelengths of colors in a part of the spectrum we can’t see,” says Mary Caswell Stoddard, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton University, who studies avian color vision. “It’s that ultraviolet light is a fundamental part of many of the colors they perceive. They’re experiencing another whole dimension of color—all the colors we can see, with varied amounts of UV mixed in. So it’s not simply human vision plus some purplish UV colors. It’s a complete reimagining of the color experience.”<br>			 While there’s no way to know what a color actually looks like to birds, Stoddard can measure with a spectrophotometer the wavelengths of light reflected by an object or a surface. This tells her whether or not a color is reflecting ultraviolet light. Then she can estimate its appearance in a way that’s relevant to bird vision using a computer program called TetraColorSpace that she developed with ornithologist</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1311" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1312</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-09 17:14:36</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">2019, biologist Dan-Eric Nilsson and his colleagues at Lund University in Sweden released photos from a camera designed to re-create how birds see color in their surroundings.

One major discovery: To birds, the dense foliage of a rainforest likely looks not like the uniform, largely flat mass of green we see, but a detailed three-dimensional world of highly contrasting individual leaves. I have tried to see this way, to pick out distinct leaves amid the wall of green, but contrasts in green are hard for humans to distinguish—which is what makes the green catbird in the rainforest so impossible to spot. UV light amplifies the contrast between the tops of leaf surfaces and their undersides, so the three-dimensional structure—the position and orientation—of the leaves pop out. This makes it easier for birds to navigate through complex leafy environments and to find food there.<br>			 Color, beauty, reality truly do lie in the eye of the beholder.<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1312" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1313</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-09 17:17:32</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr"> you think about where owls are hunting, the natural conditions they face, the Blakiston’s reliance on vision and the great gray owl’s reliance on hearing make sense, says Jonathan Slaght.

Stager also identified the specific scent that drew vultures to carrion. The discovery arose from a serendipitous conversation with field engineers at an oil company, who had been aware for some time that turkey vultures have knowing noses, and used the birds to locate leaks in natural gas lines. The engineers had figured out that if they introduced ethyl mercaptan into the line, they could locate leaks by the concentrations of turkey vultures circling above the line or sitting on the ground next to it. The same sulfurous chemical added to natural gas so the human nose can detect a leak, it turns out, is also released by an animal shortly after it dies. Thanks to Stager’s experiments, we now know that turkey vultures are highly attracted to the scent and can use it to find a target as tiny as a dead vole buried in leaves on the forest floor beneath a thick canopy of trees.<br>			 Just what makes the nose of a turkey vulture so supersensitive</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1315" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1316</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-09 17:41:15</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">By sniffing out scented compounds—one chemical in particular, dimethyl sulfide, or DMS, generated when krill devour phytoplankton.

To seabirds, it’s the scent of sustenance. “Birds tend to be attracted not to prey scents per se,” she says, “but rather to odors such as DMS that are released during feeding interactions”—a euphemistic term for the ravaging of prey by predators. In other words, says Nevitt, “predators tend to be messy eaters, and tube-nosed seabirds have adapted to pay attention to who is eating whom.”<br>			 A sensitivity to DMS also explains why seabirds consume plastics and other trash. Plastic debris emits the chemical scent, making trash smell like food and creating a kind of olfactory booby trap for seabirds.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1316" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1317</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-09 17:46:13</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">This watch zone may act as an information halo, say scientists, where uninformed birds can obtain information on the location of their patchy and mobile prey.<br>			 But here’s the example that drops the jaw: Guanay cormorants, which live and nest in colonies along the Peruvian coast, form a floating raft of birds that shifts in orientation continuously over the course of the day to indicate the direction of ephemeral prey patches.

Scientists suspect it once regularly used tools in the wild.<br>			 The most famous tool user of the bird world is the New Caledonian crow, featured in The Genius of Birds. This crow makes and keeps its own highly sophisticated tools. It’s the only species other than humans to make and use hook tools, little sticks with a hook on the end, which the bird uses to extract grubs and other invertebrates from tree holes and the nooks and crannies of plants. The crows also make very elaborate hooked tools from the leaves of pandanus trees. Pandanus leaves have little barbs along the edge, which the bird uses to latch onto its grubs. It takes a lot of complicated steps to make these tools. The birds make several methodical cuts and tears in the leaf before removing the fully crafted tool from the leaf. This suggests they have an image of the tool in their heads before they actually start making it.<br>			 In 2018, the New Caledonian crow showed us that a bird can create tools by combining two or more elements—a feat so far seen only in humans and great apes. For the experiment, researchers caught eight crows in the wild of New Caledonia and brought them to a research station at Oxford University. They presented the crows with a puzzle box the birds had never seen before, which held a small food container behind a door with a narrow open slot along the bottom. They gave the crows long sticks, which the birds promptly inserted through the slot and used to push the food out through a window in the side of the box. Then the scientists gave the crows stick pieces too short to reach the food—some hollow and some solid, with different diameters so that they could fit inside one another.<br>			 With no training or guidance, four of the crows put together the pieces within five minutes and used the longer compound pole to reach and extract the food.

Moreover, if kites and falcons have learned to manipulate fire to flush out prey, this would be the first known use of fire as a tool by any nonhuman animal, overturning some old entrenched assumptions—the orthodoxy that only humans spread fire, and that our singular mastery of fire was largely what made us masters over the environment. But it could have worked the other way around, says Bonta. “It could very well have been the case that humans, birds, and fire coevolved in some sort of mutualistic relationship—perhaps humans actually derived the idea of using fire from watching birds. This is what plenty of myths about fire-spreading among indigenous peoples in Australia and elsewhere in the world tell us, after all—birds were the original fire-starters.”<br>			 I love this idea: that a bird with a burning stick might upend old Promethean notions of human uniqueness and ecological mastery.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1319" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1320</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">annotation</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-09 18:54:21</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">	 O’Donnell doesn’t see it this way.

A few examples of their games: picking up twigs and flying with them, then drop-catching them in the air; hanging upside down by one foot while holding a toy or a piece of food, then switching the object from beak to foot and back again, time after time. One captive raven was observed tossing a rubber ball in the air again and again and catching it while lying on its back. A tipster in Arthur Cleveland Bent’s Life Histories of North American Jays, Crows, and Titmice watched ravens sliding down the high bank of a river on rolling pebbles and crumbling clay, a dozen at a time, croaking loudly with apparent enjoyment. “This noise was heard over a mile before we paddled up to the birds, where we stopped to witness their amusement.

Play is a strange behavior in any animal, says Osvath. “There are so many good reasons not to do it.” It takes a lot of energy that could be used for other purposes—growing, for instance. It’s also inherently risky. “If you’re out in the wild, and everyone is playing, then no one is paying attention to any potential threat. A bird at play is particularly conspicuous to predators, which are never far away.” The behavior seems at best extravagant; at worst, downright dangerous. “Out in the wild, playing must be very important,” says Osvath. “Otherwise, why would you make yourself vulnerable in this way? It’s a world of eagles, owls, even wolves out there. Distraction at the wrong moment could mean the end of you.”<br>			 Why would a raven play? What possible benefits could there be to larking about?

Osvath and a graduate student, Can Kabadayi, taught five ravens how to use a special tool—a stone of a specific weight and shape—to open a puzzle-like box containing a high-value treat. Though ravens are not tool users by nature, the birds were quick studies, requiring only one lesson to learn the trick—“a single observation of tool use by a non-tool-using species!” Osvath exclaims. When the experimenters took the box away and presented the ravens with a choice of objects, only one of which was the functional tool that could open the box, the birds picked the object that would be most useful to them if that treat-laden puzzle box reappeared in the future. They could wait as long as seventeen hours and would do so even when they were offered an inferior treat immediately; despite the temptation, the birds didn’t bite on the lesser alternative. Instead, they chose the special tool and saved it to secure the later, tastier reward.<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1328" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1329</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-10 01:26:25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">In fact, play is most often defined by what it is not: It is behavior that is not purposeful, serves no obvious adaptive function, does nothing to enhance an animal’s chance of survival and reproduction—nothing apparent, at least.<br>			 Not long ago, Gordon Burghardt, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, took on the problem of crafting a more positive definition of play and came up with a set of five criteria for recognizing play in any species. First, it’s behavior that’s not fully functional, although it may resemble behavior that’s useful in another context. For instance, a puppy thrashing a toy mimics a wolf’s takedown of prey, but the puppy doesn’t end up eating the toy (well, not usually, although my pitbull-lab mix has been known to). Play is exaggerated, awkward, and repetitive—like all those excessive flourishes in flight of the ravens on Santa Cruz Island—and often inappropriate. It’s also spontaneous, voluntary, intentional, pleasurable, and rewarding. It’s only initiated when an animal is adequately fed, healthy, and not under stress. In sum, says Burghardt, “Play is repeated, seemingly non-functional behavior different from more adaptive versions . . . and initiated when the animal is in a relaxed, unstimulating or low stress setting.” In other words, it’s a kind of behavioral frill—but far from a frivolous one.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1329" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1330</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-10 01:27:59</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Gulls drop-catch clams and other objects, letting them fall from the air and then swooping down to snatch them again midair.

Object play is defined as the repeated manipulation of “inappropriate” items—picking up objects, leaves, sticks, stones, tossing or dropping them, ripping them, bouncing up and down on them—and is practiced by six orders of birds, from gulls, raptors, and owls, to woodpeckers, songbirds, and parrots.

They have boundless curiosity and no fear. Whereas a raven will stare at an unfamiliar object for weeks before touching it, any new thing sparks instant investigation by a kea: “Hmm, what’s this? What can I do with this?”<br>			 “Their huge love for novel things is a bit of a mystery,” says Alex Taylor. “These birds move between subalpine forests and alpine areas. There’s not much new stuff for them to love up there. That they have evolved this thirst for novelty is really strange. But it ties in beautifully with their levels of play.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1345" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1346</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-10 01:53:01</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Jorg Massen, Schwing’s colleague who studied ravens with the Bugnyar lab, didn’t fully buy the neophilia-neophobia distinction between kea and ravens, so he conducted an informal test. He sat down next to the aviary for the ravens, birds he had hand-raised himself or worked with closely, so they knew him well. They expected good things from him and came over to see what he was doing. He pulled out his bike light, and the instant he turned it on, the birds fled. Then he went over to the kea aviary. The kea saw him walk by their aviary every day, so he was familiar, and when he sat down, they ignored him. Until he turned on the light. He was instantly cluttered with a chaos of kea.<br>			 This dichotomy affects how the different labs at Haidlhof train students to work with the two birds, says Schwing. With the ravens, students are asked to stand outside the aviary for something like two to three weeks to give the ravens a chance to get to know them before they’re allowed to interact with the birds in any way. “With kea, we do the opposite,” says Schwing: “We train our students by sending them into the aviary with the caretakers to help with the cleaning, so the kea get to know them in a routine setting. Because once we start testing, we don’t want the students to be so novel and interesting to the kea that they ignore what they’re supposed to be doing and just go play with this new person they’ve never seen before,” he says.<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1346" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1347</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-10 01:53:27</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">“I would argue that ravens are as bold as kea—but only with things and people they know.

What they don’t have is behaviors that might protect them from predators. In fact, quite the opposite. Their behavior seems designed to point a bright arrow at their big green bodies and to distract them from vigilance of any kind. This kind of bold behavior may be possible because kea have few natural predators in their native habitat. Two large birds of prey live there, the Australasian harrier and the New Zealand falcon—“pound for pound considered one of the most aggressive birds of prey in the world,” says Schwing—but neither harrier nor falcon has ever been seen killing a kea. “In fact, the New Zealand falcon is half the weight of the kea,” Schwing points out, “and the kea actually harass the falcons, dive-bombing them, all the while making play calls as if to say, ‘Come join the fun!</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1349" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1350</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-10 01:55:39</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">. For two years he recorded their vocalizations and then grouped them into seven categories, ranging from that screeching piercing “hello” contact call, which carries well over long distances and in windy conditions, to a soft whistle, barely audible but with almost magical effects on the listener (Schwing dubs it the “cuddle call”). Some of the kea at Messerli use the whistle call with Schwing, but in the wild, it’s extremely rare. Out of nearly twenty-five thousand calls he recorded, only twenty-four were this whistle. Schwing believes it’s a very personal communication between one bird and another that seems to say, “I want to have close contact.” A video he took of the whistle call shows a male perched on a bench. A female lands and moves toward him to preen him, but he kicks her away. She jumps back and then whistles quietly. He immediately lowers his head and allows her to come in and preen him. “We have birds in the aviary who can be quite rambunctious and bite hard,” says Schwing, “but when another bird gives the whistle, they become very gentle.” Schwing suspects these vocalizations are actually externalizations of the birds’ internal emotional state.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1350" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1351</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-10 01:56:24</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">At campgrounds in New Zealand’s Southern Alps, kea have been known to dive beneath parked vehicles and steal their engine hoses or to gnaw holes in the tops of camper vans.

Give Kermit a problem and he will solve it within seconds, most often in a very rambunctious, kea-like style. The birds around him watch and imitate his actions. Not long ago, a team of scientists confronted Kermit and several other kea with a puzzle: a Plexiglas box with a reward on a little platform inside that could only be won by inserting a rod-shaped stick tool into an opening and maneuvering it toward the food to push it off the platform. For kea, with their curved beaks, this is no easy task. They can’t hold a tool in alignment with their heads the way a New Caledonian crow can, so they have less control over the tip of the tool. Kermit nailed the solution with a unique routine that involved holding the tool in his beak laterally, then switching it to his foot and adjusting it with his beak until he could hold it in proper position with his foot, and then directing the tool through the opening with his beak and maneuvering it until he hit the reward.<br>			 “Kermit is very persistent and doesn’t get easily frustrated,” says Wein. “If he doesn’t get it, then there’s probably something wrong with your experiment.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1352" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1353</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-10 01:59:30</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Once kea have learned how to solve a problem or use a gadget, they don’t forget. Schwing brings out a wooden box he used in an elaborate experiment some years earlier to test the kea’s cognitive skills and ability to cooperate. The wooden box is raised on legs and bottomed by a tray that drops down if properly triggered. In the experiment, the tray was loaded with treats—parrot pellets stuck there with cream cheese. Attached to the tray were four separate chains threaded through holes in the side of the box. To release the tray and access the treats, four kea had to pull the different chains simultaneously—and continue to pull together until the tray released. If only one bird pulled at a time, the chain would slide out without moving the tray. If any of the birds lets go too soon, the tray would pop back up out of reach.<br>			 The results were impressive. Kermit led the way, and after a little training, the other kea quickly learned to pull together—and to persist—so they could all get their treats.<br>			 A couple of years later, a film and photography crew from the National Geographic Society wanted to take photos of the kea cooperatively solving the wooden box and strings puzzle. “I didn’t have high hopes,” Schwing recalls. The kea hadn’t seen the puzzle box in over a year. But he took what he thought were his four best birds and put them in a waiting compartment while the crews set up the cameras.<br>			 “It was breeding season, so there was some tension—they were chasing each other around in there,” he says. “And I thought, ‘Oh, this is not looking good.’ But the moment I opened the gate for them to get access to the box, they fell in line, one after another, not even a body length in distance between beak and tail. And in this group of four they walked right over to the box, past the photographers, past the lights, past everything, walked right up and found their places and pulled on the chains.<br>			 “We did this several times so the camera crew could get all their shots. The photographer ended up lying down with his head so close to one kea that he was blocking access to the chain. The bird walked over and just pushed the photographer’s head aside with his foot so he could get to the chain and pull on it.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1353" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1354</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-10 02:03:21</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Schwing and Wein sometimes have to hand-raise baby kea and introduce the young birds to the group. “In other parrot species, if you hand-raise chicks and put them in the group, they will more likely than not be killed because there’s always this in-group/out-of-group differentiation,” says Schwing. “You have to slowly habituate them to the group over months—putting them in a cage in the group—and gradually introduce them this way.” But with kea, it’s the opposite. “The moment we give the adult kea access to a young bird, the males almost fight with one another to see who gets to feed these unknown, unrelated birds. The first day the fledglings arrive in the group, they’re overwhelmed with food. They start beating their wings to get rid of the adults because they just can’t swallow any more food.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1354" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1355</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-10 02:06:18</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">decides to join it. A tiny shift in the position of its wings and pop! It’s gone.”<br>			 What really enthralled Schwing was the special call these birds utter only during play, a sweet, funny, squealy warble. Visual play signals are common in animals—play faces of primates, play bowing in dogs and Australian babblers. But play sounds are rarer, observed only in rats, squirrel monkeys, chimps, and cotton-top tamarins. To explore the kea calls in the wild as part of his PhD studies, Schwing set up speakers and video recorders at Deaths Corner lookout one cold and dreary winter. He deliberately chose the worst season for the study and went out in the worst weather, gloomy, cold, and drizzly, when no bird in its right mind would be in the mood to frolic. Through the speakers, he played five recorded sounds for five minutes apiece, the warbling play call; two other kea calls; a call of a common bird in the area, the South Island robin; and a simple standardized tone.<br>			 The little videos of the results are a hoot. Two adult kea just hanging around on a stone wall, minding their own business in the misty drizzle. The recording of the warbling play call is heard in the background, and suddenly the birds look at each other, burst into squeals, and launch into play, becoming exceedingly silly, chasing each other, flapping up and down, picking up rocks and flinging them, playing hard for the full five minutes of the recording.<br>			 “With the warble calls, play just went</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1355" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1356</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-10 02:06:46</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">The kea didn’t look around for the source of the sound, says Schwing, which suggests to him that the call isn’t so much an invitation, “Come play with me!” as it is an inspiration: “Playtime!” The instant the play call recording stopped, so did the play.<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1356" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1357</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-10 02:11:03</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">cientists suspect that laughter may have evolved from the breathy panting and labored breathing during play fighting and tickling between our primate ancestors and was used as a signal that everything is fine, now is a good time to socialize, play, explore together.

In his research, Jones found that magpies that attack cyclists will attack any cyclist. And those that attack posties will attack any postie.<br>			 “We think the cyclist and postie magpies are generalizing,” says Jones.

They’re watching us and interpreting our behavior.” The magpies live on average for twenty years and can remember up to thirty human faces for about that long, says Jones, “so if you anger a magpie once, you’re going to get attacked again and again.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1370" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1371</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-10 04:45:07</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">ancestors of many bird families.<br>			 Single parenting by the female is most common in birds that feed largely on fruit and nectar from tropical trees, which occur in abundance.

I was especially warmed by reports of the vigorous and persistent feeding of one bird by another of a different species: a male eastern bluebird feeding house wren nestlings, even fighting the wren parents to feed the young birds; a house wren, in turn, feeding nestling common flickers while his mate incubated the eggs on his own nest—and continuing to feed them even after his own eggs had hatched. Another house wren filled a birdhouse with nesting material but then could not find a mate, so he fed three black-headed grosbeaks with caterpillars and other foods until they fledged. As if that wasn’t enough, he then fed a family of nestling house sparrows. When a brood of eastern kingbirds were orphaned after an electrical storm, an eastern wood pewee fed the foundlings for ten days until they fledged. Likewise, a pair of starlings that lost their nest numerous times to a flood of rainwater in the drain spout they had chosen as their nesting site finally gave up their own breeding efforts and tended to some nestling American robins.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1372" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1373</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-10 05:19:16</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">They start life at the bottom of a meter of dirt and sticks and rocks,” says Jones.

This was the accepted wisdom when Naomi Langmore of Australian National University started working on cuckoos in Australia in the early 2000s. But the more field studies she looked at, the more evidence she found against this. In fact, most Australian host species tended not to reject cuckoo eggs. “Which is completely counter to evolutionary theory,” she says. “The arms race between them should exert powerful pressure on the host both to recognize foreign eggs and to reject them.”<br>			 Were the host birds down under really incapable of distinguishing between their own eggs and a cuckoo’s?<br>			 To find out, Langmore made a slew of little plastic eggs that were bright blue—different from the egg color of any host species in Australia—and placed them in the nests of a lot of different host species. She found that host birds that built cup-shaped nests could easily recognize and reject those plastic eggs. But birds that built dome-shaped nests, such as fairy-wrens, could not. This makes sense: Dome nests are dark places where it’s tough to make visual distinctions.<br>			 Then Langmore made the sort of discovery that shocks scientists and makes research on this weird system of parenting so rewarding. When she looked more closely at birds that build these dome nests, primarily fairy-wrens and thornbills, she found to her amazement that although they couldn’t reject cuckoo eggs, they had a very fine ability to recognize cuckoo chicks—and reject them. The little host birds would either seize the intruding chick and drag it out of the nest or abandon the nest altogether to start a new breeding attempt.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1375" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1376</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">The Bird Way</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Jennifer Ackerman</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-10 05:43:43</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">As for the evolution of counter-strategies in cuckoo hosts: Diane Colombelli-Négrel, a researcher at Flinders University in South Australia, and her colleagues discovered that fairy-wrens fight back against the cuckoos’ begging-call mimicry in an ingenious way: They give their young a chance to learn a password while they’re still in the egg.<br>			 Both superb and red-backed fairy-wren mothers produce special calls while they’re incubating their eggs, singing them over and over, the same tune every few minutes. The calls contain a unique note that acts like a familial password, which the embryonic chicks commit to memory. Dads learn the passwords, too.

Corvids, he believes, are at the brink of a cognitive breakthrough. They have been around for millions of years. We humans have existed as a species for at most a few hundred thousand years—in geological terms, a flash in the pan, statistically insignificant. But in the short time of our existence, crows, ravens, and other corvids have learned to use us as a source of food and shelter. If our species disappears and corvids lose this resource, there may be selective pressure among them to boost cognition, says Osvath. Their brains could double or triple in size, and with their superefficient signaling and tight packing of neurons, they might become the next big thinkers, dominant among animals.

Tired as he was, there was no hint in him of the desperate anger she had seen only a day prior. There was still grief, Dora thought, but it was tempered with something softer and less violent. “You are correct, of course,” Elias told her. “I despise these silly balls. I did not come here simply to dance.” He cleared his throat slightly. “I have again had little success today. I found myself sitting alone in the dark, tired and bitter. And I suppose I could have stayed like that. But I promised Albert that I would be kinder to myself. And so I tried to think of where I would want to be, if I were not so bound to this hopeless task.”<br>       Dora knitted her brow. “You cannot have thought of Lady Cushing’s ball,” she said sceptically.<br>       “I did not,” Elias said. “I thought of you, Dora.

She was embarrassed to realise that indeed, nearly half of her interactions with strangers had been about the weather after all. Thankfully, she had many other interactions to call upon. “If one were to breed a dolphin with a horse,” Dora said ponderously, “would the resulting creature have a dolphin’s head and a horse’s end, or would it be the other way around?”<br>       “Oh!” Lord Blackthorn said. “Well clearly, the creature would have a dolphin’s head.

Lady Carroway headed in looking very flustered, holding a vase of fresh white roses in her arms. There was something distinctly different about these flowers, however—and after a moment of looking at them, Dora realised that they sometimes looked more like mist than like roses. Those are from Hollowvale’s gardens, she thought.<br>       “These are for you, Miss Ettings,” Lady Carroway told Dora. “I think they are to entice you downstairs.” She settled the flowers onto the dresser and shook her head with a smile. “The Lord Sorcier would like a private audience with you. We all know he is not here to ask about French translations. Should I have him wait downstairs while you dress, or turn him away in order to save his pride?”<br>       Vanessa caught the implication in a moment, having just finished her own private audience with Edward only a few days prior.

Surely, you know that the rest does not matter.”<br>       Elias knitted his brow. “I do feel that it matters,” he said, and there was suddenly a note of contrariness to his voice. “One does not simply say let us go and get married, if you are amenable.”<br>       “But you did say that.” Dora beamed gently at him. “And I was amenable. I still am.”<br>       “Would you not argue with me for once?” Elias said with a flush. “Listen here, Miss Ettings! I am in love with you. You deserve to hear that. I love your wit and cleverness. I love that you are kind but almost never nice. I love your eyes and your hair and your freckles, and the fact that you smell like some monstrous floral perfume all of the time.” He paused, now looking somewhat offended at himself. “And I love to dance with you. That is the worst of it by far.”<br>       Dora blinked slowly. Each word heated up her heart bit by bit until it was a bewildering bonfire. That fire burned its way down into her mind, consuming all of the ugly things that still lingered beneath its surface. When she was alone or tired or uncertain, Dora knew that these would be the words that came to her now instead of all those others, and she could not help but smile in a silly, dreamy way.<br>       “And obviously,” Elias said with a huff, “I would like to marry you.

It was everything that a proper wedding brunch ought to be—and more besides. Elias had been in an unusually pleasant mood for weeks by then, and he was feeling so whimsical that he made the swan-folded napkins get up and flutter around for everyone’s entertainment. Vanessa’s resulting smile was nearly a magic spell all on its own.<br>       Dora’s own wedding was small, but Lady Carroway insisted on hosting a brunch at Carroway House for her as well. Albert’s mother had not forgotten her plans to open another orphanage, and much of the morning’s conversation ended up scandalously centred around those plans, rather than around the weather or the wedding. Dora thought it was the perfect sort of brunch.<br>       Life after marriage was much different than Dora might ever have imagined. In fact, it was much better in nearly every possible way—but she suspected that had much to do with her choice of husband. As a married woman, she was far more free to spend her time as she pleased; and since she was of a mind with Elias on most things, he was only too happy to let her roll up her sleeves to help both Mrs Dun and the new orphanage. Most women of the nobility had only a few children, Dora liked to say—but she had very many, and she loved them all the same. And though it was rare for Dora to feel any sense of breathless joy, she carried with her always a soft, contented glow, rather like the star upon her finger.<br>       The ton soon began to murmur that married life quite agreed with the Lord Sorcier; for while Elias would never be well-mannered, he was certainly distinctly happier. There were times, of course, when dark things threatened and great evils endangered his rest—but if he sometimes came home to sit awake in the dark, Dora always insisted at least on being with him.<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1464" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1465</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">bookmark</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">TGA VOL I</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:126px;left:-1px">astridsg@student.ubc.ca</div></td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-17 23:14:49</td><td class="s2"></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1465" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1466</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Garden Spells</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Sarah Addison Allen</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-09-18 20:29:00</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">When Claire was young, Evanelle would stop by to give her a Band-Aid hours before she scraped her knee, quarters for her and Sydney long before the ice cream truck arrived, and a flashlight to put under her pillow a full two weeks before lightning struck a tree down the street and the entire neighborhood was without power all night.

Lester would tell Henry to lead the elementary-school tours of the dairy if the teachers were the right age and unmarried. And the decorating committee at church consisted of mostly divorced women, so Lester let them come out to collect hay in the fall and holly in the winter, and he always made Henry go out to help them.

The rabbit who always won, who might drive the mean-spirited duck or the little pink man crazy with his tricks but who was never mean-spirited himself. That had been my favorite role for years and years, clever immortal guy outwitting brutish mortals but never doing them any harm.<br> Gradually the world got darker and smaller, and my job got a little dirtier. So I told myself I was the man who had to go down the mean streets, though he wasn’t mean himelf. I was still the hero, even if now and then I had to hurt somebody. And if it was kind of lonely sometimes, well, that went with the job. Philip Marlowe never got the girl, did he? He always seemed to end up alone in his rented room, no company but a bottle or a chess problem, until the door should open and another desperate soul ask for his help.<br> You really have to lie to yourself sometimes, if you’re stuck with eternal life.<br> But there would come a point where it was just no use anymore, not with the things I had to do in my line of work, and I couldn’t seem to find the role. I was the secret good guy on the bad-guy team, right, playing the Company’s hand, not really a member of the Inquisition. But for every Jew I smuggled out of the dungeons because his genetic code was unique and the Company wanted it passed on, I had to watch as twenty were burned. Hell, I helped burn them. Being able to play the sinister Spanish devil, a good meaty part, wasn’t much compensation.<br> I’d been playing Coyote for years now, really, hadn’t I?

One thing led to another, and within two weeks the New Life Chumash Nation had placed its order with the Company.

We want the total Chumash experience. Spare no expense.<br> And with those magic words, Dr. Zeus got to work. From their labs they got out all this Chumash genetic material that they, uh, just happened to have. They brought out all the carefully propagated flora and fauna of the Chumash ecosystem from their botanical and zoological gardens. They brought from their records every possible detail of Chumash folkways and culture, and boy, they sure had a lot of material.<br> The sacred ground was detoxified and bulldozed back into its original contours; it was replanted; it was restocked with animal life. Cleaning and restocking the adjacent ocean floor was harder, but, you know, they’d said to spare no expense, and who was the Company to argue? There was some outcry from historical preservationists when the picturesque old oil rigs off the coast were dismantled. Cash donations shut them up.

This was granted to him.<br>I don’t know if Maeve cared. She basked for a while in the glory of having produced a daughter, and really a very pretty one. I saw the little girl when they were parading her around. She was not so pale as her mother. Her skin was like rose petals and her hair like white gold, but she had the same great wide eyes and delicate face.<br>Yet Maeve, it seems, grew jealous of all the attention paid to her daughter. They caught her pinching the baby when she thought she was alone with it. The infant was taken away, to be raised by Lady Maire, and Maeve found herself in real disgrace for the first time in her life.<br>Lord Aegeus had no time for her now. All his attentions were focused on little Amelie, the daughter. It was decided that Maeve had performed her duties admirably, and would henceforth be allowed to rest. They allotted her a single room adjacent to the infirmary. She would be given no new husbands, as her health had begun to suffer from constant breeding.<br>So I asked if I might have her back.<br><br>The lords and ladies bestowed her on me gladly enough, commending me for my sense of responsibility, but warned me that marital relations were best not resumed. They didn’t need to say so much. Maeve had become a small wizened thing by this time, collapsed and sagging like an old woman, though she can’t have been thirty yet. Her skin had begun to mar, also, with thick white blotches of scar tissue. The lords and ladies told me it was from too much exposure to sunlight.<br>But I couldn’t leave her indoors by herself, so I swathed her in a hooded cloak and carried her about with me, and set her in the shade as I worked.<br>She talked constantly. Mostly it was bitter complaints about the way no one ever brought her presents any more, and how unfair life was. Sometimes she would wander in her mind, and hold long conversations with Fallon. I don’t think she recognized me even when her mind was clear. I wasn’t angry about this. There had been so many, after all, and maybe time and memory weren’t the same for her kind as they were for me. Whatever her kind might be.<br>I wondered if this was how the immortal ones regard my own race. Are we so brief and small and foolish in their eyes?<br>Anyway, she didn’t last long.<br>I had taken the midday meal with her, spooned soup into her toothless mouth</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1573" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1574</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">The Children of the Company</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Kage Baker</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-10-20 23:32:12</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">I had to giggle at that, I mean there I was looking at my least executive, but he</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1574" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1575</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">The Children of the Company</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Kage Baker</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-10-20 23:32:19</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">stiffened perceptibly and I thought: whoops.

So much potential in a bright child, if trained properly. All that splendid ability, wasted on one martyrdom to prop up some distant causal link to Dr. Zeus Incorporated …<br>Here is a statistic to make his heart bleed over might-have-beens: out of the four hundred seventeen mortals who heard Nicholas preach as he was being burned at the stake, fully twenty-two had heeded his plea to become martyrs to the Protestant cause themselves. Two hundred twelve had gone on to lose their lives in less immediate ways, in the defense of English liberty. Eighty-six more had gone into various levels of what passed for the secret service at that time, working for the downfall of Spain with patient fanaticism under Sir Francis Walsingham. Fifty-one had simply committed suicide, in varying ways, over the three-year period following April 1, 1555.<br>The point was, of course, that Nicholas Harpole had asked them to die, and they had. Or at least given up their lives. A miserable three hundred seventy-one mortals, when he might have laid waste to nations.<br>Much better success on the second try.

He’d been just settling in here at Mackenzie Base, and had too many irons in the fire to waste time shepherding another hapless youth from one self-destructive crisis to the next.

Consequently her emotional health was not quite what was desired in an immortal, which was another reason she’d been confined to the agricultural station.<br>Upon meeting Alec, Mendoza slept with him, accepted his proposal of marriage, and passed on to him certain classified information to assist him in his goal of bringing down Dr. Zeus Incorporated. She also disconnected the explosive device on the shuttle that was intended to destroy Alec once his usefulness to the Company ended.<br>When, after several tragic accidents, Alec managed to equip his very large yacht with a time transcendence drive so he could go back to rescue Mendoza, he discovered that Dr. Zeus Incorporated had got there first.

A tiny holoprojection cone emerged from the camera and seconds later a man appeared to stand beside the bed, big, black-bearded and villainous-looking, though his expression was kindly. Nicholas stared, fascinated even as he was repelled. He jumped when a hologram of a chair materialized behind the Captain, who sat down into it. “There now. Nothing to frighten thee.”<br>“I charge thee, Spirit, tell me! Dost thou serve the devil?” Nicholas demanded.<br>“No, sir, not I.”<br>“Dost thou serve God, then?”<br>“Well, no, sir, being what I am, which is to say no more than a device. I was made to serve Alec, sir, d’you see? Like a clock or a lute, to tell him the hour or cheer his heart. Or a dog, to guard him as he sleeps. Too low a creature to be damned or saved. Therefore, fear me not.”<br>“How canst thou speak with a man’s voice?” asked Nicholas.<br>The Captain waved his hand dismissively. “Why, sir, even a bird may be taught speech, mayn’t he, a raven or a parrot? Wherefore not then a clever mechanism? If a jack can be made to strike the hour in a clock, he may be made to speak, too; and such am I. Speak with me, then, and ease thy sick grief.”<br>Nicholas stared at him, marveling at the detail of the illusion: the movement of the Captain’s beard when he spoke, the creak of the insubstantial chair when he shifted his weight.<br>“But I am no more than thou art,” Nicholas said at last, bitterly. “A made thing, an alchemical homunculus. How shouldst thou comfort my soul, when neither thou nor I have souls, but only spirits? So might a clock comfort an astrolabe.”<br>“Ah, well, sir, I’ve no soul, to be sure; but it might help to talk, all the same.”<br>Nicholas lay back with a sigh, and gazed at the lamp.<br>“I have been disputing with myself,” he said, “since I have awakened into this unnatural life of horrible marvels, on the nature of Almighty God.”<br>“And how doth that make thee feel, lad?” inquired the Captain.

The dark glass lit up and bright letters appeared, informing him that he beheld THE OLD TESTAMENT, diligently corrected and compared with the Hebrew, by William Tyndale and finished in the year of Our Lord God A. 1536, in the month of September at Vilvorde.<br>He was struck speechless.<br>“D’you like that, eh?

Far too much time had passed for his fate to be altered now, however, even if he had been able to tell Marco.<br>Marco busied himself with arranging the table just as he wanted for what he had planned. He set out instruments, jars of chemicals; lifted Grigorii Efimovitch out to sprawl, trailing, on the steel surface. He pulled on a black rubberized raincoat, or something that looked a lot like one, and carefully worked transparent gloves on over his massive hands. He stepped out into the fast-fallen darkness and got himself another beer.<br>He drank, belched gently, and selected an instrument from the table.

It was rumored to have been transplanted, brick by brick, from some English village, back in the twentieth century when wealthy men still did things like that. It was named for the ship in which Sir Francis Drake had set out when he’d sailed off to loot the Spanish Main.<br>It had once been a very expensive bed-and-breakfast hotel, bar, and five-star restaurant. Various wars, political secessions, and natural disasters had altered its fortunes. Over three centuries it had been successively a triage hospital, a barricaded freeholding, a farmhouse, a partial ruin, and other things. But, situated as it was at a crossroads in a picturesque cove, as soon as civilization had reasserted itself enough to provide some traffic, the Pelican had evolved back into an inn.<br>Even a reasonably prosperous one, in this year of 2317. Plenty of trade from the local farmers and fishermen. Plenty of real money from the rich people who moored their pleasure boats in Muir Harbor, eager to get away from the General Prohibition in San Francisco.<br>Not that there was anything all that immoral to be had at the Pelican, of course, beyond homemade ciders and ales and fish dinners. Mavis paid a fortune in bribes to local law enforcement to be able to serve even those; but the people from the big boats wanted the thrill of the forbidden, and spent hugely for it.<br>Sometimes Mavis paid the local law enforcement to dress as picturesque smugglers, too, and they would lounge in her bar and leer pleasantly at the guests, or tell stories about desperate chases over the hills with kegs of mead. The guests would buy them drinks and would usually stay over an extra night. The local economy thrived to no end.<br>Joseph saw the amber windows</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1635" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1636</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">The Machine&#39;s Child (Company)</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Kage Baker</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-10-22 18:55:38</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">You fix that piece of crap, you get a cider, how’s about that?” he said. Joseph squinted up in dismay at the multiple images.<br>“Jeepers. What is this, the Migraine Channel? Gimme a leg up.”<br>The bartender hoisted him obligingly, and he sat on the counter and groped in his coat pocket for the case of tools he carried. It’s useful being a cyborg, even a rogue one, when you have to realign a holoemitter. Mortals think you’re an itinerant electronics genius, and so it’s all right that you’re a faintly shabby little man who never seems to have much money.<br>Joseph didn’t really need the tools, but he made a great show of using them anyway, and presently the holo images resolved and sharpened into one image, brilliantly clear in the dark midair: Mars, with the glassy dome and radiating green lines of the Martian Agricultural Collective near its equator, as a solemn voice lauded the courage of the first settlers sponsored by Areco. There was a half-hearted cheer from the patrons in the dart alley.<br>Joseph shivered, thinking that today’s courageous settlers were tomorrow’s vicious terrorists. He didn’t feel like thinking about the Mars Two disaster right now, though; this was a happy occasion, and Mars Two had another thirty-five years of blissful ignorance of its fate. He leaped down and took a little bow, then turned to the bar expectantly.<br>“So, am I good or am I good?”<br>By way of answer the bartender thrust the big embossed glass mug into Joseph’s hand. He took it smugly, strutted away to the parlor, and found himself a dark corner with a view of the fire. There he settled in with his back to the wall, and tasted his cider.

Darts plunking into the board. Somebody unused to real alcohol getting sick in Room Seven. Rush of cold air, smell of the sea and the green alder trees, somebody coming in—<br>Instantly Joseph was on his feet, peering around the corner into the hall. But it was okay: two more well-groomed people in yachting clothes, murmuring in delight at how quaint everything looked, on their way to the bar. He settled back into his seat and relaxed, drank more of his cider, watched the fire.<br>He recognized Mavis’s firm tread long before she came around the corner. He got to his feet, doing his best to look dignified and respectable for her, as he ought to look if he were the former executive consultant he always claimed to be. He knew she didn’t believe him, though in fact he’d been a consultant to a lot of people, including pharaohs, in his time; but that was okay. Their relationship wasn’t built on belief.<br>She hove into sight like a Spanish galleon, and looked him up and down.<br>“So it’s you again?”<br>“Yes, ma’am,” Joseph said, giving her his most ingratiating smile. “Just stopped by on my way up the coast. Going to a business conference in Seattle, you know. Oh, and I had a look at your holoscreen. Works fine now. Just needed a little realignment.”<br>“Really? How nice. As long as you’re here, you might look at a couple of other things that need realigning,” she told him quietly, slipping a key into his hand. “And take a shower first.

There was a waggish sign tacked up above the door, hand-lettered: THE BUREAU OF PUNITIVE MEDICINE, it read.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1645" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1646</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">The Machine&#39;s Child (Company)</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Kage Baker</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-10-22 19:14:24</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">There are no poisons?” Edward frowned down at the subject.<br>“None.

He’d lie staring up at the ceiling, watching the traveling patterns of light on water, and wonder what had happened. He’d turn his head and meet Edward’s or Nicholas’s stare, red-eyed, wretched. The memory would return and he’d begin crying again, and lie there sobbing inconsolably until Billy Bones would come creeping to the bed with the anesthesia mask, offering oblivion. Not even Edward resisted, now; and they’d all wash away to dreamless sleep again.<br>Eventually dreams began, soothing therapeutic ones that made it plain how none of this was his fault, how it had only been an error of a decimal point, how nothing could have altered what had happened because history cannot be changed, how it was wonderful that he had rescued Mendoza after all, how lucky he was to be alive . . .<br>In time he was able to be awake if he was drugged profoundly enough, and he and the others would lie there giggling feebly at the tingling stimulus Billy Bones applied to their feet, to their hands, to their ribs, to help the shattered bones knit. Once they were able to stagger upright, they wandered around the ship in matching bathrobes (Nicholas’s and Edward’s being virtual), leaning on canes. Edward said they looked like the three blind mice, and this struck Alec as hysterically funny. The two of them chortled like oafs while Nicholas tried to collect his wits enough to ask to have the reference explained. When he managed, after wiping the drool from his chin, they sang the nursery rhyme for him; and then all three tottered along, singing it over and over, making a round of it until at last they forgot the words.<br>It was good that they were able to entertain each other, for though the Captain monitored them constantly, he was very busy.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1648" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1649</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">The Machine&#39;s Child (Company)</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Kage Baker</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-10-22 20:23:32</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Fear not; I can speak in thine ear when I will.

What’s that mean?”<br>“I shall ignore your infantile humor and will be happy to explain, since you’ve inquired,” said Edward condescendingly. “I have formulated a theory of cycles of development in the history of mankind. They repeat in ever-expanding patterns, producing ages of Technology, Faith, and Reason.”<br>“Oh, that’s crap.”<br>“No, it isn’t. Technology was the first age, when primordial Man crawled from his dark shelter and discovered that by the simple expedient of striking flints in various ways he could provide himself with both fire and weapons,” Edward said. “Will you grant me that?”<br>“Okay,” said Alec grudgingly. “And?”<br>“And so the brute beast found himself, as it were, master of his universe. He had, of course, no idea of any consequences. He simply forged ahead, lighting fires and making spears, as fast as his clumsy hands could go. The result was, potentially, a greater lifespan for Man, but new and terrible responsibilities which he utterly ignored,” said Edward.<br>“Nowadays you’re supposed to say Humanity, you know. There were women back then, too,” Alec told him.<br>“Allow me my metaphor, if you please,” snapped Edward. “To continue: over the ages, the consequences of Technology did begin to make themselves evident to primitive Man. Fires, and bloodier warfare, prompted fear in his dim mind. With so much death in evidence, it was impossible not to wonder about his own inevitable demise. This prompted shamans to caper about and pretend their ancestors were giving them advice on the problem, and so was born the First Age of Faith.”<br>“And everybody went to Hell?” said Alec. Nicholas snorted.<br>“Not at all. Religion’s quite useful, at a certain level. It provides a notion of moral behavior and, as such, is the origin of ethics,” said Edward, steepling his fingers. “It is, at least, a system of thought, if it doesn’t degrade into mysticism. It got Man’s attention away from how he might more effectively spear his neighbor long enough to allow Civilization to begin.”<br></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1650" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1651</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">The Machine&#39;s Child (Company)</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Kage Baker</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-10-22 20:29:11</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">So you’re saying religion’s a good thing?”<br>“I say nothing of the kind! It’s a tool, like the flint, and as such is nothing but potential. Whether it is used to good or evil effect depends on Man, the user,” said Edward seriously.<br>“Okay.” Alec nodded. “I’ll agree with you on that.”<br>“I will not,” muttered Nicholas.<br>“Weren’t you reading? In any case, Order took form out of Chaos, and pure rational thought, Man’s highest achievement, leapt into existence!” said Edward with relish. “It attained its fullest expression amongst the classical Greeks, but the Romans applied it with the greatest effectiveness. Systematically and logically they spread Civilization throughout the known world, to a degree that was not equaled for a thousand years.”<br>“The Romans were vile and depraved,” said Nicholas, setting the text plaquette aside.<br>“They became so,” Edward agreed. “They discarded the disciplines that had made them strong. With no moral code informing their lives, life became meaningless. This coincided with what one might call the Second Age of Technology. The superior engineering skills, the advances in metallurgy, all the tremendous and brilliant machine of their empire roared along with no purpose other than serving the appetite of its creators, who had no thought for the inescapable consequences any more than brute Man with his flints had.”<br>“Well?” said Alec. “So what happened?”<br>“The judgment of God came on Rome,” said Nicholas.<br>“Absurd! Rome fell because of errors in its judgment,” Edward argued heatedly. “Without rational guidance the great machine destroyed itself, and so followed the Second Age of Faith.”<br>“The Dark Ages of Christianity, right?” said Alec. Nicholas turned to him with an expression of outrage and Edward snickered. “It’s true,” Alec insisted. “And it wasn’t just Christianity. Islam happened, too. All those people beheaded and burned at the stake over nothing, man.”<br>“Ay. Nothing,” Nicholas agreed sullenly. “Sacrifices offered up to a God of bestial cruelty. Yet even so, in that Dark Age, who but Christ’s disciples had thy precious Civilization in their keeping? Who but they, and the Jew, and the Moor with his Koran, made books and schools, lest that Aristotle become a mute ghost?

The Second Age of Reason,” Edward crowed. “True science and clear thinking at last! An Empire with real moral purpose.”<br>“Oh, hark at the Crown of Creation,” jeered Nicholas. “I’ve seen the dust wherein thine Empire fell. Rags, shrouds and cobwebs! Love was no part of its design, but only profit, and its loveless heart went to ashes at last. And thou too art humbled in thy pride, and liest here a phantom like me, dead and forgotten.”<br>Edward considered him, tight-lipped. “That remains to be proven,” he said at last. “And if the great wheel brought my age to an end, it will turn again.”<br>“The Enlightenment didn’t stop,” said Alec. “It’s still going on. We got out into space, didn’t we? We’ve got more science than you ever had.”<br>“No; you have Technology,” said Edward, a little wearily. “Tremendous power, wielded unwisely. The rest of human knowledge has been jettisoned as unnecessary. You’re illiterate, you believe in nothing, your lives have no meaning, no moral compass, no point.”<br>“Maybe because we’ve learned something you haven’t,” said Alec in a cold voice. “You and your logical systems! You think you know everything. There’s nothing to know, man, except that our genes will do anything to copy themselves. What makes you imagine the world is a rational place?”<br>“Your world isn’t, to be sure,” Edward replied. “And unless I’m mistaken, the next Age of Faith is already looming on the horizon, in the person of the Ephesian Church. Serves you right, too.”<br>Alec shuddered.<br>“But if it’s all just this big wheel going around endlessly—then we’re right, believing in nothing,” he said. “There is no point.”<br>“Yes, there is,” said Edward and Nicholas together.<br>“There is Love,” said Nicholas.<br>“There is Progress! And if, just once, a new cycle began that unified, rather than rejected the advances made by the previous ages,” said Edward, “if Faith were able to make its peace with Reason, or Technology able to grasp the principles and purpose of the other two, Mankind might make real progress at last!

It remained still as a doll until he scrubbed its face; then it put up a hand in a feeble protective gesture, as if imploring mercy, and his heart broke.<br>“Mendoza, it’s all right, it’s me,” Alec said. “Wake up, baby, please, you’re safe now. I came back for you!”<br>He flung away the towel and massaged with his hands. Then he stopped, in confusion: for the skin was fine and soft as an infant’s.<br>“She—she’s younger,” he said.<br>She were only fourteen when the immortality process was completed. The nanobots reset her. Don’t worry, son. She’ll fill out over the next couple of years.<br>“But—!” Alec’s voice rose to a shriek of dismay, as he frantically willed his imbecile flesh to stand down.<br>“No,” said Nicholas in horror. “God’s death, fool, she’s little and young!”<br>“Oh, don’t be an idiot,” said Edward hoarsely. “She’s older than Time now. What better way to bring her back to life?” He advanced across the bed, grinning. Alec felt him beginning to seize control and fought vainly; but then Nicholas gripped Edward and their wills collided like an earthquake, and Alec could do no more than cling to Mendoza as they struggled.<br>“Please,” he said. “Mendoza, I’m so sorry. Look, it’ll be just like a story. Okay? I’ll kiss you, and that’ll break the spell. Oh, please—!”<br>He clamped his mouth on the unresisting mouth and kissed desperately.<br>She shuddered to life in his arms, writhing suddenly, and took her first gasping breath from him. He lifted his mouth, rising on his elbows as her eyes opened.<br>They went wide with alarm. She made a terrified sound and backed away into the pillow, staring at him.<br>“Don’t be scared! It’s me, it’s just me,” Alec said. “See, sweetheart? We saved you.”<br>Nicholas and Edward froze in their struggle, watching. She had frozen, too, her face blank and unreadable as an animal’s.

Its conclusions were: that Crome’s radiation somehow caused an individual’s electromagnetic field to bleed over into the temporal field, which perhaps caused what appeared to be precognition or déjà vu in certain mortals. Also, telekinesis could perhaps be explained by Crome’s causing a disruption in the temporal field, freezing objects briefly in time while space (following its normal orbital trajectory) swung out from under them. This perhaps accounted for documented cases of solid objects appearing to leap off shelves or float through midair, or even rain down out of a cloudless sky.<br>It might also account for the ongoing phenomena with the garden, wherein plants shot from seed to maturity in a night. Mendoza seldom generated Crome’s on these occasions, but did seem to be able to produce the temporal distortion at will. Just how she did it remained a mystery.

The man seemed surprised that there was no mutton or goose to be had, and precious little veal; but he loaded huge bleeding clods of beef roast into his cart with both hands, and the girl concentrated on the beautifully plucked and dressed chickens. Neither of them touched the ground meats.<br>Reining themselves in with visible effort, they pushed on. The man was astonished by the selection of cheeses, took whole wheels. The nonedible items fascinated them, too; they stared and whispered, or giggled together until they were red-faced. They seemed greatly impressed by the canned goods, and selected the ones with the brightest labels. The jars of preserves and jellies captivated them; they took at least one of every color, and several jars of honey. They loaded up on coffees and teas.</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="2138751056R1680" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">1681</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">highlight</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:111px;left:-1px">The Machine&#39;s Child (Company)</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Kage Baker</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">2023-10-23 01:55:51</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">He regarded Latif and his visitor, a formidable-looking lady who would once have been described as Nubian.<br>“Nefer,” Suleyman said with genuine pleasure, holding out his hands to her.

Dr. Ansolabehere was of a most agreeable, not to say docile nature, as husbands went. He had appeared in the common room of the Goat and Compasses one night in 1660 with no belongings other than a small sea chest and the clothes on his back. After a meal, a warming glass of rum, and an hour’s charming conversation, he had somehow taken up the position in Miss Venables’s life that he had occupied, with few interruptions, ever since.<br>And really she could not, in any way, admit that she regretted the nuptial arrangement. In addition to his considerable proficiency in the arts of love, Dr. Ansolabehere was quiet and clean, and never attempted to exert control over the household although he was, as she discovered, an excellent financial advisor. He was a capable surgeon (which even the most genteel of taverns required now and then), did not drink to excess, and tolerated her occasional infidelities with the greatest amiability. Best of all, he had an absolutely reliable remedy for the Pox.<br>There were only two peculiarities about the man: his obstinate refusal to market the remedy, which Mrs. Ansolabehere found most vexing, for it might have earned them more than six sugar plantations if sold freely in Port Royal; and his sea chest.<br>The sea chest was quite small, quite heavy, and never opened.

If at any time during his temporary absence from the house the sea chest should begin to whistle, she was to let him know immediately, regardless of where he might be or what he might be doing. So firmly had he insisted upon this, and with such an unpleasant and unaccustomed light of adamance in his black eyes, that Mrs. Ansolabehere had been quite unsettled for some hours afterward.<br>Judge, then, with what vexation Mrs. Ansolabehere received the news from Caroline, her maid, that there was an odd sound coming from Dr. Ansolabehere’s room; especially since this news was conveyed whilst Mrs. Ansolabehere was greeting none other than the Lieutenant Governor himself, Captain Sir Henry Morgan, who had arrived with a party of friends and was intent on aggravating his dropsy with a few hours’determined application of Mrs. Ansolabehere’s best rum.<br>“What?” she hissed over her shoulder at Caroline.<br>“It be squealing, ma’am,” repeated Caroline.<br>“Why then, go—go poke under the bed with a broom, sure,” Mrs. Ansolabehere said. “Away! My apologies, Sir Henry. Here is my best table, with a cool breeze from the door, and here is John to serve. Will you dine, too? For I assure you I have an excellent hotpot on the fire.”<br>“No damn’d soup,” growled Sir Henry, lifting his haggard face. “I’ve enough water in me as it is.” He did not resemble the dumpy self-satisfied fellow depicted in Exquemelin’s notorious Buccaneers of America (a careful examination of its illustrations will reveal that all the pirates in that lurid compendium seem to be drawn from one model) but rather the other attributed likeness, the shadowy three-quarter portrait of the dark saturnine man in red, smiling enigmatically as the Mona Lisa. “Rum, madam! And ginger biscuits if you’ve got ’em.”<br>“To be sure,” Mrs. Ansolabehere said. “Sent hot to the table, sir, within the hour!”<br>She and Annie, the cook, were frantically getting a pan of ginger biscuits into the oven when Caroline reappeared in the doorway of the kitchen, clutching a broom.<br>“It be still squealing, ma’am,” she said, close to tears. “And it ain’t under the doctor’s bed, ma’am.

Really, he didn’t look very bad; much nicer than all those old bones. He would do, she decided, for pretend kin.<br>But what could you play with a thing that couldn’t talk back to you? Tiara thought about it and her little face brightened. She ran off to her own hiding place and returned in a moment, carrying the pink and green acrylic afghan and a beer bottle she had filled with spring water. Sitting down beside the dead slave, she pulled his head and shoulders into her lap and awkwardly wrapped him in the afghan; then she tilted the bottle to his lips, pretending to feed him, spilling water down his waxen face.<br>“Pretty little baby, pretty little baby,” Tiara crooned. “Drink your nice milk and go to sleep.”<br>She had, like all the rest of her race, the power of absolute concentration on what interested her at the moment, fixation to a degree that would baffle one of the big people. So intent on her game was she, it mattered nothing to her that the dead slave trembled abruptly, that his mouth opened and fastened on the neck of the bottle, that he proceeded to gulp down the water.<br>“Good little baby,” Tiara sang approvingly. “Such a good baby, he drinks it all gone. Isn’t he clever! Mummy’s very pleased with him.”<br>The slave lay still, gasping for breath. She lifted the bottle away and he moved his lips as though he were speaking, but Tiara couldn’t hear anything. “Oh, he’s parched, he’s parched and dry, he needs a whiskey to tell that story!” she sang. “Does he want a whiskey, then?”<br>The slave might have nodded, or it might have been a shiver. Tiara decided to play it for a nod and jumped up, running off to the spring for more water. She returned in triumph and settled back down, lifting his head and holding the bottle for him. “Drink, drink!” she chanted. “And grow up big and strong.”<br>He finished the water and sighed, and his head sagged back on her arm. His lips moved again and this time she heard him speak, distinctly, a whisper of thanks.<br>“He can talk to me,” she squealed in delight. “Talk to me more, slave!”<br>His eyes opened.

And if he does that, I won’t be able to talk to you. You see?”<br>Tiara saw. “It’s a secret,” she decided.<br>“Oh, yes, Princess Tiara, it’s our secret.

I don’t know how badly I’m damaged, but if I can regain some function—any function—” The slave began to tremble, and calmed himself. “Why, what a grand time we’ll have. And I can tell you stories—do you like stories, Princess Tiara?”<br>“Oh, yes,” she assured him.<br>“Well then! Do you know, I was a Literature Preservation Specialist—” The slave’s voice broke. He swallowed hard and went on, “And what that means is, I know every story in the wide world. I will be your own storyteller, princess dear, and nobody else will have such fine stories told. Only to you will I tell them. Will you like that?”<br>“More than anything, my prince,” said Tiara and sighed. Then, in a completely sensible voice, she added, “Except you aren’t really a prince. You’re just my slave.”<br>“Ah! Yes, but only your slave,” he insisted. “I would be slave to none but the beautiful Princess Tiara.

Sometimes Tiara would creep down to the farm and take anything that appealed to her from the big man’s kitchen, and sometimes things from his yard. Once there were towels left out to dry on the line overnight, and Tiara carried them away gleefully; for as her slave began to get better he could feel the cold, and she liked to wrap warm things about his shivering body, or wad them between him and the stony floor.<br>As Tiara got older and more skillful she learned to milk the big beasts into a jar, and would carry it back to her slave with scarcely a drop spilled. Then they’d feast on the cream, and with his throat refreshed the slave could go on with the astonishing stories, about Jason and the Argonauts, about Odysseus, about Rama and Sita.<br>Tiara loved her slave.

Down in the dark, Princess Tiara drank of a different brew, began to grow into another kind of Quean entirely.<br>Her tastes did form around romances, as she grew. Every tale of chivalry and passion the slave had ever sung when he’d been a troubadour, she loved: Tristan and Isolde, Arthur and Guinevere, Pelleas and Melisande. Every jongleur ditty about Robin and Marian. All the Shakespeare love plays, acted out in the slave’s beautiful voice and with the gestures of his one good hand. Heathcliff and Cathy, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester enchanted Tiara.

No use; he couldn’t make those parts work, damaged as he was, and he explained that it wasn’t good for a little girl to start that sort of play too early anyway. Carefully, phrasing with exquisite tact, he made a request. She agreed, and the next night she went down to the farmhouse and rummaged around in the big man’s bedroom as he slept.

He’s not quite sure what the other two entities are. They were once living men, earlier versions of Alec produced by the same Company responsible for creating him from recombinant DNA. When they had served the Company’s purpose and been killed, an electromagnetic recording of their personalities—memories, emotions, skills—had gone into storage in their files and remained there, inactive, until Alec accidentally downloaded them into his own brain while fleeing from the Company into the deep past.<br>The result was a remarkable case of multiple-personality disorder for Alec and a continuing logistical nightmare for the Captain. The only thing on which the three gentlemen wholeheartedly agreed was the fact that they loved Mendoza, who had known each of them in their successive incarnations.<br>Nicholas Harpole, who lived in the sixteenth century and was a scholar and heretic, managed to adjust somehow to massive culture shock and loss of the foundation on which his religious beliefs stood; but then he was an extraordinary man.<br>So was Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax.<br>Edward lived in the nineteenth century and was a political agent for the British Empire. He absorbed all the virtues and most of the vices of that massive institution, along with the cold-blooded practicality that enabled him to do his very unpleasant job. He died heroically in the service of the Gentlemen’s Speculative Society, an earlier version of Dr. Zeus Incorporated. His subsequent discovery that they lied to him most of his brief life has not been received well and, unfortunately for his creators, Edward has read Frankenstein.<br>He doesn’t think much of his other selves, either.<br>He dismisses Nicholas as a medieval zealot, limited by ignorance and religious superstition. Cybergenius Alec is in his opinion a dunce, the inevitable product of a soft and degenerate age, and worse: for Alec had been naïve enough to smuggle weapons to a particularly foolhardy group of rebels, and the result had been the destruction of an entire colony on Mars. Hence Alec’s flight, with technology he’d stolen from Dr. Zeus, into the past.<br>Edward’s perception of these other selves has decided him that he alone is fit to inhabit Alec’s body. His effort to achieve this state of independence has been partly responsible for the accident that brought him, maimed and broken, to the regeneration tank, and Mendoza to her present state of impairment, and Alec and Nicholas to … well, to the place they now inhabit.<br>But even if the accident had not occurred, Edward’s efforts to kill Alec should have been in vain.

Dr. Zeus explained to its little cyborgs that mortals perceive time in a linear way, because they have no other frame of reference; but in reality (they said) it is more of a spiral than a line, and when you learn to step across from one part of the spiral to another, you can travel through time.

As usual.<br>Whoever first learned how to travel in time, whether it was the Company or those little pale people from whom it stole its technology—it appears they took one look at the awful incoherent vastness of it all, screamed, and hastily projected conduits of artificial linear time with which to travel through the mess in a more or less orderly way. The restriction against being able to travel forward in time was a result of the conduit system.

Every so often it lost its grip, for one reason or another; either the winter storms would precipitate a slide or the San Andreas Fault would shrug, and greater or lesser portions of Garrapatta would plummet into the sea.<br>But its handful of citizens were a hardy lot, long accustomed to minor inconveniences like abrupt changes in elevation or rappelling down cliffs to purchase groceries. There were so many reasons to stay there! The breathtaking view of the Pacific, the grandeur and isolation of the coastline, the bubbling springs, the fresh air …<br>All the same, when the last bad El Niño had relocated the entire business district (five of the town’s eight public buildings had landed in a colony of elephant seals) there was reluctant talk of abandonment. The Protector had come to Garrapatta’s rescue, however.<br>Yes, Mr. Hearst had kindly evacuated the refugees and provided shelter for them down the coast at San Simeon while he brought in engineers, architects, and the most expensive antigravity technology. Over a period of five years the townsite was stabilized, the road restored, the businesses rebuilt. The citizens of Garrapatta now had every assurance that, regardless of how much the mountain moved in future, antigravity would keep their community exactly where it was. Any problems related to floating in midair could be solved with a few sturdy foot bridges.<br>The return of the natives was quite a gala event. They were loaded into Mr. Hearst’s own superyacht, provided with box lunches and taken up the coastline to the new boat landing he had built next to the former seal colony. There they disembarked and rode in the new antigravity elevator up to Garrapatta, where a brass band on the deck of the new general store played “Home, Sweet Home.” One of Mr. Hearst’s public relations people (he seldom appeared in public himself) then provided the townsfolk with a guided tour of the civic improvements.<br>Every least shack and vegetable patch had been faithfully restored, the general store was more spacious, the Vertical Café had lost none of its crusty charm, and the Garrapatta Springs Hotel had plumbing and new towels in case they ever had guests. Nor was this all: Mr. Hearst had even provided Garrapatta with a ninth structure, the Phoebe Apperson Hearst Memorial Cultural Center.<br>This was a great improvement on the old Garrapatta Cultural Center, which had been housed in the hotel lobby and consisted of three holoes and a broken holoprojector. The new cultural center loomed grandly above the town, a building of reinforced concrete dug well into the mountain, with an ornate façade in Spanish Renaissance style. Within was stored a library of over a million entries in holo entertainment, games, music, and even literature, though the only one of Garrapatta’s citizens who could read was the cultural center’s new curator, Joseph X. Machina.

I heard the high notes of a violin being played, and light flared behind my eyes. I saw another life, the one I might have lived in some other Spain, where a little girl never fell into the hands of dubious strangers or the Inquisition. Bright and detailed as film, the brief lifetime unspooled itself for my consideration: the girl grew up and made her way to England somehow, and became the wife of a somewhat less outspoken young vicar named Nicholas Harpole. Forty years of wedded bliss in a thatched cottage, Sabbath sermons, living perhaps long enough to see a Shakespeare play. Then sunlight in the green churchyard, and quiet dust…<br>We broke the surface and gasped for air, with shuddering pleasure. I heard the sea roaring. Edward tightened his grip and dove again, bearing me with him, and the roar grew louder. I saw white sails above a blue sea, brilliant sunlight. I saw an England where Commander Bell-Fairfax forbore to strike a senior officer, and came home a hero instead, and married a Spanish girl he met, perhaps in Gibraltar, where they settled down. Fifty years, perhaps, of respectability, thrifty life on an officer’s half-pay, a little stone house kept neat as a pin; then one monument carved with names and dates, loving husband, beloved wife.<br>Up into the air again! I couldn’t get my breath; it didn’t matter. We were sinking together in the dark water but it was warm now, and I heard laughter. I saw a fantastic Eurospain as carefree as a travel poster, where Alec Checker-field went to party instead of going to Mars, and there during Purim carnival met a girl, and dared to try his luck at marriage a third time, and the third time was the charm. Dance clubs, endless serene cruises, a fashionable address in London. Would they have had sixty years, this life? Seventy? The end might have come quickly, or it might have lingered out in hospital corridors, but the end result the same: white ashes scattered on the seafoam, sinking into blue …<br>But we were rising.

The first in caught his bundle, advanced to the far end of the cargo bay and waited. He was there joined by the next in line with his bundle, and the next. When the last Enforcer had boarded Albert closed the loading doors and took a bundle for himself, as Ron sprinted to the transport’s cabin and keyed in a signal. The console beeped in acknowledgment and the autopilot activated; with a lurch and a whine the transport rose into the storm, and kept rising, and sped westward at last.<br>The Enforcers, meanwhile, were busily dressing themselves out of the duffels. There was some muttered amusement, even laughter, at the clothing that had been provided for them. Not uniforms by any stretch of the imagination, no, in fact all the garments had in common was that they were all triple-X sizes. There were Levis and cotton fleece exercise pants, there were chinos and Bermuda shorts and pinstriped trousers. And the shirts! Pastel Izods, rugby pullovers, long-sleeved oxfords, T-shirts in all colors printed with every possible advertising logo, though there were perhaps more for the Hearst News Services 2348 Company Picnic than any other. It had not been easy to stockpile so many big clothes, in a world where the mortal race had dwindled. There were no shoes available at all.<br>Having dressed themselves, the Yorkshire contingent was issued field rations and fed, as the transport hurtled on. They were then ordered to draw from their duffels the last items each man had been issued: two lengths of oak, six meters of ramilar cord, two flint nodules, and a hammerstone. It wasn’t necessary to tell them what to do next. To a man, they dropped into a comfortable crouch and their enormous supple hands went to work, expertly knapping stone. With almost no effort the flint axe heads began to take shape.<br>They were beautiful things, in a horrible kind of way, faceted sharp as razors at one end and blunt and heavy at the other.

Jade beads clicked out the rhythm against his chest, in the long passage of the dance where the drums fell silent. The audience watched, rapt, waiting for a misstep that never happened, though sweat fell from his body like rain; every step perfect, balanced, effortless. While he danced, it was possible to believe he held the universe together, and would dance forever.<br>He was Agustin Aguilar, twenty-two years old, Flatley Scholarship winner, principal dancer with Ballet Folklorico de Veracruz. It was the eve of his wedding.<br>For that reason he left the party after the show early, programmed his car for Acapulco, and cranked back his seat so he could get some sleep on the long drive. The city lights fell behind. For a while there were stars; they slipped gradually under a wall of black cloud, but by then Agustin was sleeping and didn’t see the red flash of lightning, miles ahead in the mountains to the west.<br>It was hours before the strike came. It jolted him awake when it hit, a flare of light brighter than the sun, and the afterimage as all the instruments on the console burned out. Then, a drop and an impact that rattled his teeth, a prolonged scream of metal, a fan of sparks thrown up to either side; the car’s ag drive had cut out and it had fallen to the road, was hurtling forward across asphalt, slewing to one side as it came. Off the edge of the road it went, into a ditch, with a sickening jar.<br>Agustin could see nothing but pitch blackness for a moment. A light approached, diffused through the dust cloud he’d raised. He threw off his shock enough to shout, to pound on the transparent canopy, to grope for the emergency release lever. The canopy was jammed, but someone was outside now, yanking on it, a black silhouette backlit by headlights through the roiling dust. The canopy was wrenched away with a shriek and someone was hauling him out bodily. Agustin was set on his feet, shivering in the night air. “Are you all right, man?” shouted his rescuer.<br>“I think so,” said Agustin through chattering teeth, staring at the stranger.

He seemed a little older than Agustin, had a lean somber face and Indian cheekbones, a black gaze like a flint knife.<br>“My God,” said the stranger. “Struck by lightning! Your car’s fried, my friend.” He pointed down at the hood where paint had bubbled away to bare steel at the edges of the black hole, out of which white smoke and floating ash streamed upward.<br>“My tuxedo—” Agustin started forward, but the man stopped him like a stone wall.<br>“I’ll get it,” he said brusquely, and a second later was handing Agustin his suitcase and garment bag. “Come on, my son, let’s get you to Acapulco.”<br>Agustin was grateful for the warmth of the stranger’s truck, for the hot soup from the stranger’s thermjar, for the use of the stranger’s Shisha to notify the car rental agency, for every kilometer that took him away from the wreck and closer to Marisol.<br>“So, what’s the tuxedo for?” said the stranger. His face was spookily lit by the green console lights.<br>“I’m getting married tomorrow,” said Agustin. “Today, I guess. The ninth. I have a lot to thank you for, Mr …?”<br>“Aguilar,” said the other. “Porfirio Aguilar.”<br>“I’m Agustin Aguilar! Do you think we might be related?”<br>“Maybe,” said Porfirio. He accelerated, racing the night to get the boy to his wedding day, one gesture of hope at the end of time.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
