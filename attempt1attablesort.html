<td>I don’t think so. For me these are banal situations … There is nothing extraordinary or different about these things that happen to many people—having sex, eating meat. I don’t have a particular feeling that I want to shock anyone. On the contrary, when I was following Sophie around I was very afraid that it would be a cruel thing to do. That was, until I realized that it was only provocative to other people, not to Sophie herself. In some ways I thought her entire body of work up to that point had been a request for someone to follow her like this. And so I did. I feel sure she enjoyed it. I’ve never spoken to her, though. I suppose we’ve said everything to each other that there is to say.</td>
